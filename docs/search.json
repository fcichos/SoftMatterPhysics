    "text": "2.1.1 Fundamental Quantities\nWe can define different thermodynamic systems depending on their ability to exchange energy and particles with the environment.\n\nA system is called isolated if it can neither exchange energy nor particles with its environment. This ensemble of particles is also called \\(micro-canonical\\). The energy in such a system can not fluctuate. It is a closed system if it can exchange energy with the surrounding, i.e., a heat bath keeping it at a constant temperature. The ensemble of particles in such a system corresponds to a canonical ensemble. Energy can fluctuate. In case the system can also exchange particles, it is called an open system or grand-canonical ensemble.\nA thermodynamic system can be defined by state variables \\(p\\), \\(V\\) and/or \\(T\\). State functions are useful to formulate the laws of thermodynamics. A state function is independent of how one arrived at that particular state. They are most often used to characterize an equilibrium state.\n\nNote: State Function and State Variables\n\nState function is a function of state variables that depends only on the state of the system.\nState variables characterize the state of a system and are independent of how the system got there.\n\n\nWe will refer to a number of state functions during the course. Here is a list of the most useful ones:\n\nInternal energy \\(U\\) (state function):\n\nState function. The total energy contained in a thermodynamic system. It is the energy necessary to create the system with the major components kinetic energy and potential energy.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nU=Q+W\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe internal energy can be changed by supplying heat or doing work on the system such that\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ndU=dQ-pdV\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nEnthalpy \\(H\\) (state function):\n\nThe enthalpy \\(H\\) of a system is measuring the internal energy plus the product of volume and pressure.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nH=U+pV\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe enthalpy is especially useful for a system at constant pressure \\(p={\\text{const.}}\\), i.e., for processes where the volume can not be controlled.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}H=\\mathrm{d}U+p\\mathrm{d}V+V\\mathrm{d}p=\\delta Q + V\\mathrm{d}p\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this case the change in enthalpy of a system corresponds to the exchanged heat.\n\nEntropy \\(S\\) (state function):\n\nThe change of entropy of a system is given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}S=\\frac{\\delta Q}{T},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) denotes the temperature and \\(\\delta Q\\) the heat exchanged in a reversible process.\n\nFree Energy \\(G\\) or \\(F\\) (state function):\n\nFree energies are useful for systems which can exchange energy with the environment but not particles. In such non-isolated systems we define the\nGibbs Free Energy\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nG=H-TS\n\\end{equation}\\]\nfor a system with constant pressure and\nHelmholtz Free Energy\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nF=U-TS\n\\end{equation}\\]\nfor a system with constant volume. Both quantities are used to indicate in which direction physical or chemical processes proceed. After we have written down the two first laws of thermodynamics, we will have a look at a specific example.\n\n\n2.1.2 Laws of Thermodynamics\n\n2.1.2.1 First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe internal energy \\(U\\) is connected to the first law of thermodynamics:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm dU=\\delta Q+\\delta W=\\delta Q-p\\mathrm dV\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich states, that the energy contained in a system can be changed by providing heat or performing mechanical work on the system. Here \\(\\delta Q\\) and \\(\\delta W\\) are no state functions. They characterize a process of delivering heat or performing mechanical work.\n\nNote: First Law of Thermodynamics\n\nThe internal energy of a system can only be changed by exchanging heat with the environment or by doing mechanical work on it (energy cannot appear or disappear).\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Second Law of Thermodynamics\nWhile the internal energy \\(U\\) may be fixed (i.e., \\(\\mathrm{d}U=0\\)), the system may exist in different configurations (see, for example, and ideal gas with different arrangements of molecules). Such an isolated system will always evolve such that the change in entropy is positive or zero (\\(\\mathrm{d}S\\ge 0\\)). This is equivalent to the formulation that the entropy becomes maximized.\n\nNote: Second Law of Thermodynamics\n\nWhen an isolated system is left alone long enough it evolves to thermal equilibrium whose entropy is at least as great as before (\\(\\mathrm{d}S &gt; 0\\)).\n\n\n\nExample: Closed System in Contact with Reservoir\nLook at the above figure of the closed systems (inner part) inside a temperature bath (reservoir). If we apply the 2nd Law of thermodynamics to reservoir and system we write down\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}S_{\\text{tot}}=\\mathrm{d}S_{\\text{R}}+ \\mathrm{d}S_{\\text{S}}\\ge 0.\n\\end{equation}\\] The system may exchange energy with the reservoir and, thus, according to the 1st Law of thermodynamics we have\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}U_{\\text{R}}=T\\mathrm{d}S_{\\text{R}}-p \\mathrm{d}V_{\\text{R}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith \\(T\\) being the constant temperature of the reservoir. We may transform this equation and insert it into the 2nd law to obtain:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}S_{\\text{S}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U_{\\text{R}}}{T}+\\frac{p}{T}\\mathrm{d}V_{\\text{R}}\\ge 0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nUsing \\(\\mathrm{d}U_{\\text{R}}=-\\mathrm{d}U_{\\text{S}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}V_{\\text{R}}=-\\mathrm{d}V_{\\text{S}}\\) we can transform the equation for constant pressure and temperature to\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d}G=\\mathrm{d}(U_{\\text{S}}+pV_{\\text{S}}-TS_{\\text{S}})\\le 0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis indicates the direction in which a closed system, that can exchange energy with a bath, develops according to the 2nd Law of thermodynamics.\nIf we bring a small system into thermal contact with a reservoir, which is in equilibrium at temperature T, then the reservoir will stay in equilibrium at the same temperature, but the small system will come to a new equilibrium, which minimizes the free energy.\nThus, in equilibrium the free energy reaches a minimum value. Free energy minimization does two things at the same time: It tries to minimize the internal energy/enthalpy as well as to maximize the entropy (due to the negative sign in front of the entropy term) of a non-isolated object. The free energy minimum is, thus, the optimal balance between the two extrema.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Entropy Definition by Boltzmann\nThe term of entropy becomes very important in that context. It measures the number of different ways a system can be rearranged to yield the same macrostate. It is, thus, an indicator for the microscopic degeneracy of a macrostate. In this context the definition of entropy by Boltzmann is well known, i.e.,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS=k_\\mathrm{B} \\ln(W)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) is the number of microstates corresponding to a system’s macrostate with and energy \\(E\\). Here \\(k_\\mathrm{B}=1.38064852 × 10^{-23} \\mathrm{m^2\\, kg\\, s^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}\\) is the Boltzmann constant. Below are two examples of how to use the formula for the calculation of the entropy.\n\nExample: Entropy of an N letter word\n\n\n\nletters\n\n\nConsider the number of states \\(W\\) of a word with \\(N\\) letters of \\(M\\) different characters. The letter can be arranged in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nW=M^N\n\\end{equation}\\]\ndifferent ways such that the entropy is given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS=N\\, k_\\mathrm{B} \\ln(M) = k_{\\text{B}}\\sum_{1}^{N} \\ln(M)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich just tells that entropy is an additive quantity.\n\n\nExample: Arrangement of molecules along a chain\n\n\n\nbinding\n\n\nWe consider a linear molecules (perhaps a DNA) that has \\(N\\) binding sites for, e.g., proteins. \\(N_\\mathrm{p}\\) sites are occupied with a protein where the binding energy is equal for each site. The number of different ways in which the \\(N_\\mathrm{p}\\) proteins can be arranged on the \\(N\\) sites is given by the binomial coefficient\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nW(N_\\mathrm{p};N)=\\frac{N!}{N_\\mathrm{p}!(N-N_\\mathrm{p})!}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTherefore, the entropy is given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS=k_\\mathrm{B} \\ln\\left ( \\frac{N!}{N_\\mathrm{p}!(N-N_\\mathrm{p})!}\\right )\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich can be further simplified using the identity\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(N!)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\ln(n)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand the Stirling approximation\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\ln(n)\\approx \\int_1^{N}\\ln(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\approx N\\ln(N)-N.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis, finally, leads to\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS=-k_\\mathrm{B} N [c \\ln(c)+(1-c)\\ln(1-c)]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith \\(c=N_\\mathrm{p}/N\\) being the mean occupation of each site or the probability to find a state occupied.\n\nBelow you just find some Python code calculating the entropy as a function of “concentration” using the Stirling approximation and the original formula. You also recognize there, that the Stirling formula is not yet very good, since \\(N=100\\).\n\n\n\nstirling\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Shannon Entropy\nA different access to entropy comes from the field of information theory and has been devised by Claude Shannon. Information theory is trying to mathematically assess the information content of a measurement facing uncertainty. It will turn out further below that this alternative description results in the Boltzmann distribution and effectively amounts to making a best guess about the probability distribution given some limited knowledge about the system such as the average energy.\nThe Shannon entropy is defined by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS\\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{N}\\right)=S\\left(\\left\\{p_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{i} \\ln p_{i}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand relates to its thermodynamic version, the Gibbs entropy\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS\\left(\\left\\{p_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=-k_\\mathrm{B}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{i} \\ln p_{i},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(p_i\\) is the probability of the \\(i\\)th microstate (or outcome). The example below will show, that if only the normalization of the probability is known, maximization of the Shannon entropy will directly lead to an equal probability of events (uniform distribution). Later, we see that similar calculations can be done to yield the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nExample: Uniform distribution\nTo figure out that the Shannon entropy is indeed delivering some useful measure, we will have a look at a measurement which has \\(N\\) outcomes (e.g., rolling a dice). We, of course, know that in this case all numbers of the dice have equal probability, but we can test this by maximizing the Shannon entropy as required by our thermodynamic considerations earlier.\nTo do so, we use the technique of Lagrange multipliers, which allows us to set a constraint while maximizing the entropy. This contraint is for this example, that\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i}^{N} p_{i}=1\n\\end{equation}\\]\ni.e., that the probability is normalized to 1. With this constraint we maximize the entropy by adding an additional term with the contrain multilied by the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nS^{\\prime}=-\\sum_{i} p_{i} \\ln p_{i}-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{i} p_{i}-1\\right).\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe see, that if the probability is normalized to 1, we do not change the entropy. Our procedure is to find that set of probabilities \\(p_i\\) which maximizes this augmented entropy function.\nThe derivative of the augmented entropy with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) yields the normalization condition, i.e.,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial S^{\\prime}}{\\partial \\lambda}=-\\left(\\sum_{i} p_{i}-1\\right)\\overset{!}{=} 0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDifferentiation with respect to the probabilities yields\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial S^{\\prime}}{\\partial p_{i}}=-\\ln p_{i}-1-\\lambda\\overset{!}{=} 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich directly gives\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np_{i}=\\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTogether with the normalization condition we therefore obtain\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda}=1\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand since the exponent does not depend on \\(i\\) we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda}=\\frac{1}{N}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nor\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np_{i}=\\frac{1}{N}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is the expected equal probability of finding one of the \\(N\\) outcomes.",

    "text": "3.2 Boltzmann Distribution\nOur previous consideration of the state functions has shown, that thermal equibrium is associated with a minimum in free energy. As the free energy consists of internal energy \\(U\\) (or enthalpy \\(H\\)) and an entropic term (\\(-TS\\)), we may understand this minimization as a competition between the minimization of the internal energy and a maximization of the entropy (since it is \\(-TS\\)). The figure below illustrates this competition for a gas in the gravity field.\n\n\n\nentropy\n\n\nThe internal energy minimization yields just a condensed layer at the bottom of the container, while the entropy maximization will try to spread the particles evenly (middle picture). The compromise of both at finite temperature is given by the barometric height formula, i.e.,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np(z)=p_0\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{m g z}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}\\right ),\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(p(z)\\) is the probability to find a particle at height \\(z\\), \\(m\\) is the mass of a particle, \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration and \\(p_0\\) is a normalization constant. The result actually gives a hint at some very fundamental distribution, which always provides the free energy minimum in thermal equilibirum. This distribution is the Boltzmann distribution.\nThe Boltzmann distribution is an approach of statistical physics to describe a thermodynamic system in equilibrium. The idea is hereby to deliver probability distributions for the probability of all different microstates. Key distinguishing feature of different microstates is their energy \\(E_i\\) (that was so far neglected in the examples above), where \\(i\\) indicates the \\(i\\)th microstate.\nThe Boltzmann distribution tells us precisely the probability of finding a given microstate with energy \\(E_i\\): If a particle is in equilibrium with its environment then the probability of finding the particle in state \\(i\\) with energy \\(E_i\\) is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np(E_i)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{E_i}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}\\right ).\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe normalization factor \\(1/Z\\) contains the so-called partition function \\(Z\\):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nZ=\\sum_{i}\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{E_i}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}\\right )={\\text{const}}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIt ensures that the total probablity to find a system in any of the states is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_i p(E_i)=1.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n3.2.1 Mean Energy\nThe Boltzmann distribution is useful to calculate also expectation values, for example, of the total energy of the system (the mean energy \\(\\langle E\\rangle\\)).\nThe mean is defined by: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\langle E \\rangle=\\frac{1}{Z}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{i}\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{E_i}{k_\\text{B} T}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAbbrevating \\(\\beta=(k_\\mathrm{B} T)^{-1}\\) we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\langle E \\rangle=\\frac{1}{Z}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\bigg(- \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\beta}\\exp\\left ( -\\beta E_i\\right)\\bigg),\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere the sum is nothing else than the derivative of the partition function\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\langle E \\rangle=-\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\beta}Z\n\\end{equation}\\]\nor just\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\langle E \\rangle=-\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\beta}\\ln(Z).\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n3.2.2 Free Energy\nEmploy the Gibbs entropy \\(S=-k_\\mathrm{B}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{i} \\ln p_{i}\\) to find a relation between the free energy \\(F\\) (or \\(G\\)) and the partition function.

The partition function thus allows us to calculate the free energy.\n\n\n3.2.3 Deriving the Boltzmann Distribution\nThere are a number of ways to derive the Boltzmann distribution. We will have a quick look at a classical derivation of the Boltzmann distribution for a closed system, e.g., a system which is in contact with a reservoir as depicted below.\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\nSystem (index s) and reservoir (index r) have total energy \\(E_{\\text{tot}} = E_{\\text{r}} + E_{\\text{s}}\\). We assert now, that the probability to find the system in a specific microstate \\(p(E_{\\text{s}}^{(i)})\\) with the energy \\(E_{\\text{s}}^{(i)}\\) is directly proportional to the number of states available to the reservoir, when the system is in that state. The ratio of the probabilities of two states is then equal to the ratio of the number of states of the reservoir, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\frac{p(E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})}{p(E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)})} = \\frac{W_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})}{W_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)})}.\n\\]\nHere, the function \\(W_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})\\) is the number of states available to the reservoir, when the system is having the energy \\(E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)}\\).\nWe can now rewrite the above equation in terms of the entropy using \\(W(S(E)) = \\exp(S(E)/k_\\mathrm{B})\\) such that\n\\[\n\\frac{W_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})}{W_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)})} = \\frac{\\exp(S_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})/k_{\\text{B}})}{\\exp(S_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)})/k_{\\text{B}})}.\n\\]\nWe may now expand the entropy to first order\n\\[\nS_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{s}}) \\approx S_{\\text{r}}(E_{\\text{tot}}) - \\frac{\\partial S_{\\text{r}}}{\\partial E} E_{\\text{s}}\n\\]\nconsidering that \\(E_{\\text{s}}\\) is only very tiny as compared to the total energy of the reservoir. Using the thermodynamic identity that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial S_{\\text{r}}}{\\partial E}|_{V,N} = \\frac{1}{T}\n\\]\nwe finally find\n\\[\n\\frac{p(E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)})}{p(E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)})} = \\frac{\\exp(-E_{\\text{s}}^{(1)}/k_{\\text{B}} T)}{\\exp(-E_{\\text{s}}^{(2)}/k_{\\text{B}} T)}\n\\]\nwhich corresponds to the ratio of two Boltzmann distributions\n\\[\np(E_{\\text{s}}^{(i)}) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\text{s}}^{(i)}}{k_{\\text{B}} T} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(Z\\) is the previously mentioned normalization factor, which is called partition function.\n\nExample: Barometric height formula\nWe have mentioned already the barometric height formula giving the probability of finding a particle at a height \\(z\\). To derive that, we consider a constant gravitational force \\(F = -mg\\) along the \\(z\\)-direction such that the potential energy is given by \\(E = mgz\\), assuming that \\(E = 0\\) at \\(z = 0\\).\nThe probability for finding the particle at position \\(z\\) is therefore\n\\(p(z) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{mgz}{k_{\\text{B}} T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\langle z \\rangle} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{z}{\\langle z \\rangle} \\right)\\).\nNormalization provides the value of the partition function\n\\(Z = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left( -\\frac{mgz}{k_{\\text{B}} T} \\right) \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{k_{\\text{B}} T}{mg}\\).\nWe may further calculate the mean height, which is the sedimentation length in sedimentation problems:\n\\(\\langle z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\int_0^\\infty z \\exp\\left( -\\frac{mgz}{k_{\\text{B}} T} \\right) \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{k_{\\text{B}} T}{mg}\\)\nand the mean energy:\n\\(\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(Z) = +\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(\\beta mg) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} = k_{\\text{B}} T = mg \\langle z \\rangle\\).\n\n\nExample: Boltzmann distribution is the maximum entropy distribution in which the average energy is prescribed as a constraint\nWe can also obtain the Boltzmann distribution from the Shannon entropy by constraining the Shannon entropy. With only the normalization as a constraint in entropy maximization, we obtained equally likely microsates. If we now constrain the mean energy \\(\\langle E\\rangle\\) of the system, we obtain a distribution which maximizes the entropy under this condition. The mean energy is given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}      \n\\langle E\\rangle=\\sum_{i} E_{i} p_{i},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nsuch that we can add another constraint to our augmented entropy. We now have a Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\) for the normalization of the probability and a second one \\(\\beta\\) which is multiplied by the energy constraint.\n\\[\\begin{equation}    \nS^{\\prime}=-\\sum_{i} p_{i} \\ln p_{i}-\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{i} p_{i}-1\\right)-\\beta\\left(\\sum_{i} p_{i} E_{i}-\\langle E\\rangle\\right).    \n\\end{equation}\\]\nTaking the derivative\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial S^{\\prime}}{\\partial p_{i}}=-\\ln p_{i}-1-\\lambda-\\beta E_i\\overset{!}{=} 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nresults in\n\\[\\begin{equation}     \np_{i}=\\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda-\\beta E_{i}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand together with the normalization condition \\(\\sum p_i=1\\) finally\n\\[\\begin{equation}    \n\\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda}=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta E_{i}}},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere we already recognized that we can replace the prefactor \\(\\mathrm{e}^{-1-\\lambda}\\) by \\(1/Z\\) with \\(Z\\) being the partition function\n\\[\\begin{equation}     \nZ=\\sum_{i} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta E_{i}}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nOverall this, therefore, leads to the Boltzmann distribution\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np_{i}=\\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta E_{i}}}{\\sum_{i} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta E_{i}}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is quite interesting. We have just fixed the mean energy of the system and maximized the entropy. The Boltzmann distribution is therefore the probability distribution which maximizes the entropy under as little as possible additional information (just the mean energy).\nThe only thing that is missing in the above formula is an expression for the value of \\(\\beta\\), the Lagrange multiplier. This can be obtained when knowning the mean energy. In thermal euilibrium, this mean energy can be obtained from the equipartition theorem.",

Actually, no additional information on the details of the solute and solvent are currently required, though if we want to have numbers, we would need to know which solute or solvent we are looking at.\n\n\n\nSolute Solvent\n\n\nSuppose we have\n\n\\(N_\\mathrm{H_2 O}\\) solvent molecules (e.g., water),\n\\(N_\\mathrm{s}\\) solute molecules (e.g., proteins).\n\nThe solute chemical potential is defined by\n\\[\n\\mu_\\text{s} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_\\text{tot}}{\\partial N_\\text{s}} \\right) \\bigg|_{p,T}\n\\]\nor intuitively as\n\\[\n\\mu_\\text{s} = G_\\text{tot}(N_\\text{s}+1) - G_\\text{tot}(N_\\text{s})\n\\]\nThe total free energy \\(G_\\text{tot}\\) consists of the enthalpy of forming the solvent molecules \\(N_\\mathrm{H_2O} \\varepsilon_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\) and the enthalpy of solvating the solute proteins \\(N_\\text{s} \\varepsilon_\\text{s}\\):\n\\[\nG_\\text{tot} = N_\\mathrm{H_2O} \\varepsilon_\\mathrm{H_2O} + N_\\text{s} \\varepsilon_\\text{s} - TS_\\text{mix}\n\\]\nThe last term \\(TS_\\text{mix}\\) denotes the entropy for mixing the solute and the solvent molecules.\nIn the following, we are interested in the last term, which is the entropic contribution to the free energy containing the entropy of mixing solute and solvent.\nThe mixing entropy can be calculated by either the Gibbs definition\n\\[\nS_\\text{mix} = -k_\\text{B} \\sum_{i} p_{i} \\ln(p_{i})\n\\]\nor the Boltzmann definition\n\\[\nS_\\text{mix} = k_\\text{B} \\ln(W)\n\\]\nWe will use the latter definition, including the number of possible configurations, to obtain the mixing entropy. If the total number of molecules in the volume is \\(N = N_\\mathrm{H_2O} + N_\\text{s}\\), we can write down the number of different ways to arrange the molecules as previously done.

The value of \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{s}}\\) is termed the standard chemical potential \\(\\mu_{\\text{s}}^{0}\\).\nThe standard chemical potential is measured at standard thermodynamic conditions, i.e., \\(p_0 = 101.3\\, \\text{kPa}\\), \\(T = 293.15\\, \\text{K}\\), and \\(c_0 = 1\\, \\text{M}\\).\n\nIn a mixed system, we define the chemical potential of a component \\(i\\) as the sum of two components\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mu_i=\\mu_i^0+k_\\mathrm{B} T \\ln \\left ( \\frac{c_i}{c_{i,0}}\\right ).\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe standard chemical potential is a molecular property (see slides) that contains\n\nthe internal energy/enthalpy to create the molecule,\nthe conformational entropy of the molecule, and\n\nthe enthalpy and entropy contributions when bringing the molecule into contact with the solvent (solvation free energy).\n\nThe logarithm term \\(k_\\mathrm{B} T \\ln \\left ( \\frac{c_i}{c_{i0}}\\right )\\) is the pure mixing/dilution entropy reflecting the different abundance of solute and solvent due to the resulting numbers of microstates.\n\nFor a solvent we consequently write\n\\[\n\\mu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{\\partial G_{\\text{tot}}}{\\partial N_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} \\bigg|_{T,p} = \\mu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}^{0} - k_\\text{B} T \\left( \\frac{c_{\\text{s}}}{c_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} \\right)\n\\]\nFinally, a chemical potential may also be defined for gases, e.g., for the ideal gas:\n\\[\n\\mu_{\\text{iG}} = k_\\text{B} T \\ln\\left( \\frac{p}{p_0} \\right)\n\\]\nwhich only has entropic contributions.\n\nExample: Barometric height formula\nWe can have a look again at the barometric height formula using the framework of the chemical potential. Each height \\([h,h+\\mathrm{d}h]\\) is exchanging particles with other heights until the chemical potential in all regions is the same. We can thus write\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}    \n\\mu(h=0)&=&\\mu_{0}(h=0)+k_\\mathrm{B} T\\ln \\left ( \\frac{n(h=0)}{n_0}\\right )\\\\\n&=&\\mu_{0}(h)+k_\\mathrm{B} T \\ln \\left ( \\frac{n(h)}{n_0}\\right )    \n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nThe standard chemical potential is just given by the potential energy, i.e.:\n\\[\\mu_{0}(h)=mgh\\]\nand\n\\[\\mu_{0}(h=0)=0\\]\nwhich then leads us to\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n-mgh=k_\\mathrm{B} T\\left ( \\ln \\left( \\frac{n(h)}{n_0} \\right )    -\\ln \\left( \\frac{n(h=0)}{n_0} \\right ) \\right).\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis finally leads us to\n\\[\\begin{equation}    \n\\frac{n(h)}{n(h=0)}=\\exp\\left (-\\frac{mgh}{k_B T} \\right )\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is, of course, the barometric height formula.",

    "text": "8.1 Liquid-Liquid Unmixing\nConsider two liquids consisting of molecules A and B, which we will bring together and mix. The mixing should happen at constant volume and temperature. We can therefore use the Helmholtz free energy as the quantity that is minimized.\nInitially, the separated components have the free energies \\(F_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) and \\(F_{\\mathrm{B}}.\\) After the mixing, the free energy that derives from the mixing is \\(F_{\\mathrm{A+B}} - (F_{\\mathrm{A}} + F_{\\mathrm{B}}).\\) If the volume fraction of component A is \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) and the one of component B is \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) such that \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1\\) (incompressibility of the mixture), then we can calculate the mixing free energy.\nFirst, we calculate the mixing entropy \\(S_{\\mathrm{mix}}\\) from\n\\[\nS = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_{i} p_{i} \\ln(p_{i})\n\\]\nwhich results in\n\\[\nS_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} (\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}})).\n\\]\nIn addition to the mixing entropy, we have to calculate the change of the internal energy as well. This internal energy consists of an energy term that comprises the interaction of two molecules of the same type A (\\(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}}\\)), one of two molecules of the same type B (\\(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BB}}\\)), and one between the molecules A and B (\\(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AB}}\\)). If we assume that each site in the liquid has a number of neighbors, then the interaction energy of this site is\n\\[\nz \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}}.\n\\]\nA fraction of \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) sites is occupied with molecules A and, thus, the interaction energy reads\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{2} \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}}.\n\\]\nSimilarly, expressions for the interaction of B molecules and the interaction of A with B can be obtained. To calculate the change in internal energy when mixing the two species, we still have to subtract the internal energy of the two separated components, \\(z \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}}/2\\) and \\(z \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BB}}/2\\), such that we obtain\n\\[\nU_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{z}{2} \\left[ (\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}} + (\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BB}} + 2 \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AB}} \\right].\n\\]\nUsing this expression as well as \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1\\), we can define an interaction parameter\n\\[\n\\chi = \\frac{z}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} (2 \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AB}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BB}})\n\\]\nsuch that\n\\[\n\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} = \\chi \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}\n\\]\nby utilizing, for example, \\((\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} (\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} - 1) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}} = -\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}}\\).\nThis finally yields the free energy of mixing\n\\[\n\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}) + \\chi \\phi_{\\mathrm{A}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}.\n\\]\nWe can now plot this free energy of mixing as a function of the volume fraction of component A.\nFree energy of mixing as a function of the composition of the binary liquid mixture for different interaction parameters.\nThe free energy function has a minimum at a composition of \\(\\phi=0.5\\) for all \\(\\chi\\) smaller than 2. In this region of interaction parameters, the two liquids are always miscible at any composition. For \\(\\chi\\) larger than two, the free energy function reveals two minima, i.e., there are two compositions under which the mixture is stable (one left in phase B and one right in A). The location of these two minima defines what is called the binodal or coexistence curve, which separates the unstable from the stable region in a phase diagram (Figure 4). As the interaction parameter is proportional to \\(1/T\\), these stable compositions are a function of the temperature.\nTo understand the stability of a mixture, let us shorten the notation first. In all of the following considerations, we will denote \\(\\phi=\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}.\\) We will start with two mixtures we have prepared, which have a composition \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\phi_2\\). If we take a volume \\(V_1\\) of the first mixture and a volume \\(V_2\\) of the second one and combine them to a volume \\(V_0\\), then the two mixtures form again a new composition with\n\\[\n\\phi_{0}V_{0} = \\phi_{1}V_{1} + \\phi_{2}V_{2}.\n\\]\nWe can divide by \\(V_0\\) and introduce two new volume fractions \\(\\alpha_1\\), \\(\\alpha_2\\) to yield\n\\[\n\\phi_{0} = \\frac{V_{1}}{V_{0}}\\phi_{1} + \\frac{V_{2}}{V_{0}}\\phi_{2} = \\alpha_{1}\\phi_{1} + \\alpha_{2}\\phi_{2}.\n\\]\nThe total free energy of the system of the two separated mixtures at these volume fractions can then be written as\n\\[\nF_{\\mathrm{sep}} = \\alpha_{1}F_{\\mathrm{mix}}(\\phi_{1}) + \\alpha_{2}F_{\\mathrm{mix}}(\\phi_{2}).\n\\]\nWe can add this free energy as a function of the volume fraction \\(\\phi_0\\) to our free energy curve, for example, for an interaction parameter \\(\\chi &lt; 2\\). The two initial concentrations lie on the coexistence curve, but the starting composition \\(\\phi_0\\) is not. Its initial free energy is \\(F_{\\mathrm{sep}}(\\phi_{0})\\) and it is on a line connecting the points with the initial compositions, Figure 2. Since the actual free energy curve of the mixture is always lower than any point of the line denoting the separate free energies, the mixture is stable. This is true as long as the free energy curve is convex.\nLet’s change the free energy curve to a situation with a maximum at \\(\\phi=0.5\\). If we look at two situations, where one is in the region of the maximum and the second is next to the minimum (Figure 8.1). Close to the maximum, the line with the free energy of the separate components always falls below the free energy curve of the mixture. The composition is therefore unstable. Close to the minimum, however, the composition is stable, yet, the mixture is not at the minimum of the free energy curve. Eventually, the system will evolve towards the free energy minimum and thus the mixture is called metastable.\nFigure 8.1: A line plot on a polar axis\nApparently the above analysis has done nothing else than measuring the sign of the curvature of the free energy curve. We can summarize the conditions as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 F_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi^2} &&gt; 0 \\ldots \\text{stable}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 F_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi^2} &&lt; 0 \\ldots \\text{unstable}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 F_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi^2} &= 0 \\ldots \\text{spinodal line}\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3 F_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi^3} &= 0 \\ldots \\text{critical point}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe spinodal line therefore separates the metastable from the unstable region. It corresponds to the inflection points of the free energy curve. The critical point, beyond which no phase separation can be achieved at any concentration \\(\\phi\\), is defined by setting the third derivative to zero.\nPhase diagram of an ideal mixture. The interaction parameter is plotted as a function of the composition. The individual regions as defined by the above equation are indicated.\nWe can now plot this free energy of mixing as a function of the volume fraction of component A.",

    "text": "If two liquids are brought together at a composition that is either unstable or metastable, they will phase separate. The kinetics of this phase separation can proceed in different ways.\n\nSpinodal Decomposition – In this case, thermal fluctuations will amplify density fluctuations. The material will diffuse “uphill” to the regions of higher concentration to yield phase separation. The boundaries of the two phases are blurred in this case. Spinodal decomposition is the process of phase separation in the unstable region.\nNucleation – In the case of nucleation, a thermal fluctuation will create a nucleus of a critical size, which further grows in time. The nucleus has a sharp boundary with the other phase. Nucleation is the process of phase separation in the metastable region.\n\nWe will treat both kinetic regimes separately.\n\n9.0.1 Spinodal decomposition\nBased on Fick’s law, we know that the diffusion currents occur in the direction against a composition gradient, i.e., \\(J = -D \\nabla \\phi\\). The result of that diffusion process is an equal composition in the whole sample. For phase separation to happen, material needs to flow from regions of low concentration to regions of higher concentration, so in the direction of the composition gradient. Material transport is therefore not balancing composition gradients. In the section about the chemical potential, we learned that in an open system the chemical potential of all species is balanced. The chemical potential is given by\n\\[\n\\mu = \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi} \\right|_{V,T}.\n\\]\nIf now the second derivative of the free energy with respect to \\(\\phi\\) is positive, the regions with larger \\(\\phi\\) have larger free energy. Thus regions of lower concentration are favored by the free energy and the diffusion happens to be downhill as given also by Fick’s law. If the second derivative of the free energy is, however, negative, then fluctuations in the composition will lower the free energy and, thus, the fluctuations will grow in strength. The fluctuations with different length scales will, however, not grow at the same rate. The spectrum of growth rates can be described by a phenomenological theory known as the Cahn–Hilliard equation, which is applied in many fields. To arrive at that equation, we need to describe the free energy in terms of composition gradients\n\\[\nF = A \\int \\left[f_{0}(\\phi) + \\kappa \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right)^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nHere, \\(f_0\\) is the free energy density, \\(A\\) an area, and \\(x\\) a linear coordinate. To balance the chemical potentials we need to modify Fick’s laws\n\\[\nJ = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}, \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J}{\\mathrm{d}x}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}\n\\]\nto an appropriate new law\n\\[\nJ = -M \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}x},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu = \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) is the difference between the chemical potentials of \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{B}\\). This is apparently a linear approximation. According to the definition of the chemical potential, we obtain\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi} \\left[f_{0}(\\phi) + \\kappa \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right)^2 \\right]\n\\]\nfrom which follows\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f_{0}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi} + 2\\kappa \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2},\n\\]\nwhere it was applied that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right)^2 = 2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}.\n\\]\nInserting this into our modified Fick’s law yields\n\\[\nJ = -M f_{0}^{''} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} - 2M\\kappa \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3 \\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^3}\n\\]\nwith \\(f_0^{''} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 f_0}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi^2}\\). Finally, inserting the above equation into the continuity equation yields\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = M f_{0}^{''} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + 2M\\kappa \\frac{\\partial^4 \\phi}{\\partial x^4}.\n\\]\nThis is the Cahn–Hilliard equation, which extends the diffusion equation for interacting species. The term in front of the second derivative yields an effective diffusion coefficient, i.e., \\(D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = M f_{0}^{''}\\). While the coefficient \\(M\\) (the Onsager coefficient) is always positive, the second derivative of the free energy density \\(f_0\\) can be positive or negative. Inside the spinodal line, for example, the curvature of the free energy is negative. Following that, the effective diffusion coefficient is negative, which allows for our uphill diffusion. The Cahn–Hilliard equation can be solved by a Fourier decomposition which yields\n\\[\n\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_{0} + A \\cos(qx) \\exp\\left[ -D_{\\mathrm{eff}} q^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\kappa q^{2}}{f_{0}^{''}}\\right) t \\right].\n\\]\nHere \\(q\\) is a wavenumber defining the wavelength of the fluctuations. The exponent can be abbreviated by\n\\[\nR(q) = -D_{\\mathrm{eff}} q^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\kappa q^{2}}{f_{0}^{''}}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich is nothing else than an inverse time or a rate coefficient. It provides the relaxation rate for a specific wavenumber. This rate coefficient is positive up to a certain wavenumber \\(q_0\\). All fluctuations with wavelengths larger than \\(\\lambda_0 = 2\\pi/q_0\\) are amplified in time. The fastest-growing fluctuation is obtained at \\(q_{\\mathrm{max}}\\). This wavenumber sets the length scale of the structures, which typically appear during the spinodal decomposition.\n\nSpinodal decomposition\nHere is an example of the structure formation by spinodal decomposition taken from a recent paper Prum et al. (2009).\nThe feathers of birds (see image) or even butterflies are in many cases not color because they contain dye molecules whose electronic transitions yield selective absorption.\n\n\n\nbarb\n\n\nRather than that, these feathers are equipped with nanostructures at a given lengthscale which coherently scatter light as a Bragg lattice for example, or a photonic crystal. The image below shows two examples of such nanostructures that can selectively scatter light.\n\n\n\nbarb_structure\n\n\nThese structures are supposed to be formed by spinodal decomposition or nucleation and growth.\n\n\n\n9.0.2 Nucleation\nNucleation is the phenomenon of spontaneously generating a phase-separated volume by thermal fluctuations. By doing that, we create an interface between the two phases, which costs energy. We, therefore, have a first simple look at the interfacial energy.\n\n9.0.2.1 Interfacial Tension\nIf we have a system of two components A and B and those components do not mix but form an interface, then, due to the fact that both sorts of molecules repel each other, we have to spend energy to bring them together. The work done to create an interfacial area is\n\\[\nW = F \\Delta x = \\gamma L \\Delta x,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) denotes the interfacial energy. If work is done, this would require an energy exchange with a reservoir to keep the temperature constant. That, however, also means that the interfacial energy is a free energy per unit area rather than an internal energy. Interfacial energies may contain entropic contributions. In the case of a sharp interface, we can use the interaction parameter \\(\\chi\\) and the molecular volume \\(v\\) to show\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2v^{2/3}} (2\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AB}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AA}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BB}}) = \\frac{\\chi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{z v^{2/3}}.\n\\]\nIf we have a liquid mixture now at a certain composition, which is in the metastable region, i.e., \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\phi^2} &gt; 0\\), all of the density fluctuations in our system are damped and the spinodal decomposition cannot happen. Therefore, the system has to phase separate by nucleation, i.e., that spontaneously a droplet of a certain size is formed and grows further. As we need energy to create the interface but also gain free energy by forming a volume phase, we need to have a look at the total free energy change when the droplet is formed.\n\nThe volume part is delivering a free energy gain per volume of \\(\\Delta F_v &lt; 0\\), which has to be multiplied with the volume of the droplet.\nThe creation of an interface requires interfacial energy \\(\\gamma\\), which is always positive and has to be multiplied with the droplet surface area.\n\nThus, the total free energy change reads\n\\[\n\\Delta F(r) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\Delta F_{v} + 4 \\pi r^2 \\gamma.\n\\]\nNote that the first term is negative as \\(\\Delta F_v\\) is negative. A typical free energy change with the particle size is shown in the figure below. It has a maximum at the position \\(r^*\\), which creates a nucleation barrier \\(\\Delta G^*\\). Droplets which are spontaneously formed at \\(r &lt; r^*\\) can decrease their free energy by dissolving.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nLiquid-Liquid Unmixing - Ouzo Effect\nOne example of liquid-liquid unmixing by nucleation is the Ouzo or Louche effect. The name denotes the spontaneous formation of a turbid microemulsion when a solution of anethol in ethanol is diluted with water. The figure below shows the phase digram of this ternary mixture, meaning that it has three components.\n\n\n\nouzo\n\n\nWhen the emulsification happens, the solution rapidly moves to the metastable region between the binodal and spinodal lines. It occurs because the alcohol, as it diffuses from the anethol into the water, carries with it some of the anethol molecules that still have a finite solubility in alcohol and alcohol/water mixtures. As the alcohol diffuses further into the water, the associating anethol(oil) molecules become expelled from the water-rich solution and are stranded in the form of fine emulsion droplets. Thus, adding water to a solution of homogeneous oil/ethanol mixtures leads to an abrupt decrease of the solubility of oil in the water-rich continuous phase. This effect causes the strong local concentration fluctuations of solute molecules and homogeneous nucleation can start.\nThe image below shows the turbidity of the emulsion to appear as the water content is changed.\n\n\n\nouzo_1\n\n\nThe data has been taken from: Sitnikova et al. (2005)\n\n\nNucleation and Growth\nAnother example of nucleation and growth is the growth of tiny ssemiconductor nanocrystals from solution. Such quantum dots confine electron hole pairs and have size dependent optical properties. This finding was awareded with the nobel prize in chemistry in 2023.\n\n\n\nnucleation_growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrum, Richard O, Eric R Dufresne, Tim Quinn, and Karla Waters. 2009. “Development of Colour-Producing β-Keratin Nanostructures in Avian Feather Barbs.” Journal of The Royal Society Interface 6 (February): S253–65. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2008.0466.focus.\n\n\nSitnikova, Natalia L., Rudolf Sprik, Gerard Wegdam, and Erika Eiser. 2005. “Spontaneously Formed Trans-Anethol/Water/Alcohol Emulsions:  Mechanism of Formation and Stability.” Langmuir 21 (16): 7083–89. https://doi.org/10.1021/la046816l.",

When forming a crystal, the system needs to spend energy on creating the interface between liquid and solid, which requires a surface free energy to come from somewhere.

We also know that at a first-order phase transition all energy inserted into the system (the latent heat \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}\\) at the melting temperature \\(T_{\\mathrm{m}}\\)) is going into a change in the entropy of the system, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\partial T} \\right)_{p} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{\\mathrm{l}}}{\\partial T} \\right)_{p} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}}{T_{\\mathrm{m}}}.\n\\]\nWe can, therefore, extrapolate the free energy change at the undercooled temperature by\n\\[\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{b}} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}}{T_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\Delta T\n\\]\nwhich yields\n\\[\n\\Delta G = -\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}}{T_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\Delta T + 4 \\pi r^2 \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}.\n\\]\nAccording to our nucleation theory, this yields a critical radius of the nucleus of\n\\[\nr^{*} = \\frac{2 \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}} T_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}} \\Delta T}.\n\\]\nA nucleus of size \\(r &lt; r^*\\) would thus have the tendency to dissolve again, while a nucleus of size \\(r &gt; r^*\\) is ready to grow continuously. The critical radius of the nucleus corresponds to a free energy barrier\n\\[\n\\Delta G^{*} = \\frac{16 \\pi}{3} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}^3 \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta T^2}.\n\\]\nThe probability of critical nucleus formation can thus be determined from the Boltzmann factor\n\\[\ne^{-\\frac{\\Delta G^{*}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}}\n\\]\nwhich is a very strong function of temperature. Inserting typical values, e.g., for water/ice, we find the following free energies as a function of the nucleus radius (\\(\\Delta T = 10\\, \\mathrm{K}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe free energy barrier is therefore about 1500 times bigger than the thermal energy. Homogeneous nucleation from the bulk liquid phase thus essentially never happens. Even at a strong undercooling of about 50 K as shown in the plot below, the free energy barrier is about 65 times bigger than the thermal energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to that, homogeneous nucleation, i.e., the freezing of a liquid is very unlikely and actually does not happen. More likely are heterogeneous nucleation events, which occur at the boundaries of the container or at impurities.\n\n\n10.0.2 Heterogeneous Nucleation\nTo study the process of heterogeneous nucleation, we have a look at a container wall, which acts as a nucleation catalyst. At this container wall, a solid droplet in the form of a spherical cap exists.\n\n\n\nimage-5.png\n\n\nThe solid material shall have a contact angle of \\(θ\\) with the catalyst surface. In this case, the contact angle obeys Young’s law \\(γ_{\\mathrm{sl}} \\cos(θ) = γ_{\\mathrm{cl}} - γ_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\). Further, for the calculation of the volume and interfacial contributions, we need the volume and the surfaces of the spherical cap as well as the surface at the catalyst interface, which all together read:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV &= \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^3 (1 - \\cos(\\theta))^2 (2 + \\cos(\\theta)),\\\\\nS_{\\mathrm{sl}} &= 2 \\pi r^2 (1 - \\cos(\\theta)),\\\\\nS_{\\mathrm{cs}} &= \\pi r^2 \\sin^2(\\theta).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFollowing the earlier arguments, we can write down the free energy change upon nucleation of a spherical cap of a radius \\(r\\) at the catalyst surface as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta G(r) &= \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^3 (1 - \\cos(\\theta))^2 (2 + \\cos(\\theta))\\\\\n&+ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}} 2 \\pi r^2 (1 - \\cos(\\theta))\\\\\n&+ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\pi r^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)\\\\\n&- \\gamma_{\\mathrm{cl}} \\pi r^2 \\sin^2(\\theta).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWith the help of Young’s equation, we can simplify this to:\n\\[\n\\Delta G^{*} = \\frac{16 \\pi}{3} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}^3 \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta T^2} \\left( \\frac{(1 - \\cos(\\theta))^2 (2 + \\cos(\\theta))}{4} \\right).\n\\]\nThe latter fraction is actually only an additional geometrical factor that depends only on \\(θ\\), while all factors before just resemble the homogeneous nucleation result. The graph below displays this geometrical factor \\(f(θ)\\) as a function of the contact angle \\(θ\\) and indicates that the creation of a nucleus with a certain contact angle at a solid wall considerably lowers the nucleation barrier. The nucleation barrier can thus be easily as low as thermal energy, as shown in the graph below for the water/ice system. The nucleus size in that model stays the same, while a contact angle of about 14° yields a nucleation barrier of \\(1\\, k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry factor for the heterogeneous nucleation of a droplet with a contact angle at a catalyst wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNucleation barrier as a function of nucleus radius for heterogeneous nucleation at a wall. The curves display the results for the water/ice interface.\n\n\n10.0.3 Classification of phase transitions\nA classification of different phase transitions can be carried out using the scheme of Ehrenfest. According to that, a phase transition is categorized based on the order of the derivative of the free energy that shows discontinuity at the transition point.\n\\[\ndG=-SdT+VdP+\\mu dN\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P}=-S \\quad \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P} \\right)_{T}=V\n\\]\n\n\n\nclassification_fig_01\n\n\n\nphase transitions at the phase boundary\ncharge is\n\ndiscontinous - first order phase transition\ncontinous - second order phase transition\n\n\n\n\n\nclassification_fig_02\n\n\nThe Ehrenfest equations with \\(m = 1, \\dots, n-1\\) are\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\alpha}}{\\partial T^{m}} \\right|_{P} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\beta}}{\\partial T^{m}} \\right|_{P}\n\\qquad\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\alpha}}{\\partial P^{m}} \\right|_{T} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\beta}}{\\partial P^{m}} \\right|_{T}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\alpha}}{\\partial T^{m}} \\right|_{P} \\neq \\left. \\frac{\\partial^{m} G_{\\beta}}{\\partial T^{m}} \\right|_{P}\n\\qquad\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{n} G_{\\alpha}}{\\partial P^{n}} \\right|_{T} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial^{n} G_{\\beta}}{\\partial P^{n}} \\right|_{T}.\n\\]\nlack at the derivative of \\(G\\) as a fraction of the temperature.\n\n10.0.3.1 First Order Phase Transitions\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} \\right|_{P} = -S, \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P} \\right|_{T} = V, \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N} \\right|_{T} = \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\(G\\) has a kink (discontinuous)\n\\(\\curvearrowright\\) \\(S\\), \\(V\\) have a jump\n\\(\\curvearrowright\\) \\(\\mu\\) has a kink\n\n\\[\nC_{P} = \\left. \\frac{dH}{dT} \\right|_{P} = T \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} \\rightarrow \\infty\n\\]\n\nlatent heat \\(\\rightarrow\\) melting, evaporation\n\n\n\n10.0.3.2 Second Order Phase Transitions\n\n\\(G(T, P)\\) is continuous\n\n\\(S(T, P)\\), \\(V(T, P)\\) are continuous\n\nspecific heat\n\\[\nC_{P} = T \\left. \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} \\right|_{P} = -T \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} G}{\\partial T^{2}} \\right)_{P}\n\\] is discontinuous\n\nisothermal compressibility\n\\[\n\\kappa_{T} = -\\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P} \\right)_{T} = -\\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} G}{\\partial P^{2}} \\right)_{T}\n\\]\n\nthermal expansion coefficient\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} G}{\\partial T \\partial P} \\right)\n\\]",

    "text": "11.3 Coulomb forces, charge–charge interactions\nThe simplest but at the same time also one of the most important types of interaction is the electrostatic interaction, e.g., of simple charges. This type of interaction is important not only due to its relevance in biological systems, but the electrostatic interaction is in principle the only one delivering a long-range repulsive force.\n\n11.3.1 Charge–charge interactions\nCharge–charge interactions are mediated by electric fields. Assume that we have a charge \\(Q_1\\) that creates an electric field\n\\[\nE_{1} = \\frac{Q_{1}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon r^2}.\n\\]\nWe neglect the vectorial character of the electric field to avoid further complications. The electric field creates a force on a second charge \\(Q_2\\)\n\\[\nF(r) = Q_{2} E_{1} = \\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon r^2}.\n\\]\nFor such a charge assembly at the distance \\(r\\), an energy is stored, which is the potential energy of assembling these two charges from infinity. The free energy of the two charges thus reads\n\\[\nw(r) = \\int_{\\infty}^{r} -F(r)\\, \\mathrm{d}r = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon r^2}\\, \\mathrm{d}r = \\frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon r}.\n\\]\nIf we evaluate this energy, for example, for a sodium and a chlorine ion at a distance of \\(r = 0.276\\, \\mathrm{nm}\\), we find a free energy of interaction of \\(w = -8.4 \\cdot 10^{-19}\\, \\mathrm{J}\\), which corresponds to about \\(200\\, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\) at \\(300~\\mathrm{K}\\) temperature. This is on the same order of magnitude as covalent interactions. It requires about \\(3~\\mathrm{nN}\\) to break this bond. The long-range character of electrostatics becomes clear when evaluating the distance at which this interaction becomes comparable to \\(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\): \\(r = 56\\, \\mathrm{nm}\\). This is only considering a pair of ions. In a NaCl crystal, multiple neighbors contribute to the interaction energy of one sodium ion with its surroundings. One sodium ion has 6 \\(\\mathrm{Cl^-}\\) neighbors at a distance of \\(r = 0.276\\, \\mathrm{nm}\\), 12 \\(\\mathrm{Na^+}\\) neighbors at \\(\\sqrt{2}r\\), and further 8 \\(\\mathrm{Cl^-}\\) neighbors at \\(\\sqrt{3}r\\), and so on. We have to sum up all the interaction energies for the total cohesive energy of the sodium ion in the crystal:\n\\[\n\\mu^{0} = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r} \\left[ 6 - \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{6}{2} + \\ldots \\right] = -1.748 \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\nThe factor in front of the Coulomb term (the one in the square brackets) is termed the Madelung constant and is known from solid-state physics. It is characteristic for specific lattice types, such as a simple cubic lattice in this case. Note that the cohesive energy of one sodium ion is therefore about \\(350\\, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\) and is thus much larger than the thermal energy, keeping the NaCl crystal stable. Yet, it can be dissolved in water very easily.\n\n\n11.3.2 Born energy of solvation\nThe Born energy of solvation calculates the free energy of assembling a charge inside a dielectric medium of dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\). Let us reconsider the free energy:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{d}U = \\mathrm{d}Q + \\mathrm{d}W\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\mathrm{d}U = T \\mathrm{d}S + \\mathrm{d}W\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Leftrightarrow \\qquad \\mathrm{d}W = \\mathrm{d}U - T \\mathrm{d}S\n\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[\n\\mathrm{d}F = \\mathrm{d}U - T \\mathrm{d}S = \\mathrm{d}W.\n\\]\nTherefore, the free energy change is related to the energy to assemble a charge:\n\\[\n\\Delta F = \\frac{\\epsilon \\epsilon_0}{2} \\int_V E^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int \\mathrm{d}w = \\int_0^Q \\frac{q \\, \\mathrm{d}q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon a} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Q^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon a}.\n\\]\nTo find the free energy, we integrated the square of the electric field over the volume (this is equivalent to adding tiny charge elements against previously assembled parts of the charge). According to this, the free energy of a charge \\(Q = z e\\) per charge in a medium with dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\) is\n\\[\n\\mu^{0} = \\frac{z^2 e^2}{8\\pi \\epsilon \\epsilon_0 a}\n\\]\nif the charge has a radius \\(a\\). Now, if we look at the difference between assembling the charge in vacuum (\\(\\epsilon = 1\\)) and in a medium with dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\), we find the following difference in the chemical potential (free energy):\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mu^{0} = -\\frac{z^2 e^2}{8\\pi \\epsilon_0 a} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 \\right) = -\\frac{28 z^2}{a} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 \\right) k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\quad \\text{per ion at} \\quad T = 300~\\mathrm{K}.\n\\]\nThis is the Born free energy of solvation of a single ion. The molar free energy is obtained by multiplying with Avogadro’s number \\(N_{\\mathrm{A}}\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta G = N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\Delta \\mu^{0} = -\\frac{69 z^2}{a} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 \\right) \\mathrm{kJ/mol}.\n\\]\nAdditionally, we have:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mu^{0} \\approx \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon (a_{+} + a_{-})}.\n\\]\nThe mole fraction dissolved in water is then found using the Boltzmann factor:\n\\[\nX_{\\mathrm{s}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mu^{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}\n\\]\nwhich is a measure of the solubility of ions. Inserting the formula for the chemical potential yields the proportionality \\(X_{\\mathrm{s}} \\propto \\exp(-\\text{const}/\\epsilon)\\). This dependency on the dielectric constant of the solvent is observed experimentally, though this is only a trend and some solvents deviate from this behavior.\n\n\n\nSolubility\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\nDielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\n\n\n\nWater\n78.5\n\n\nEthanol\n24.3\n\n\nAcetone\n20.7\n\n\nHexane\n1.9\n\n\nPolystyrene\n2.4\n\n\nSodium Chloride\n6.0\n\n\n\nThe reasons for deviations are:\n\nThe theory assumes continuous changes in interactions, but in reality, there is local ordering.\nAdditional interactions like hydrogen bonds exist.\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Interactions involving polar molecules\nMany molecules exhibit a dipole or even higher moments due to the uneven distribution of charges over the molecular structure. Some atoms have a stronger tendency to accept charges than others, a property typically measured by electronegativity. This gives an idea of whether atoms donate or accept charge when binding to other atoms. While homo-atomic bonds do not have dipole moments, hetero-atomic bonds often do, as shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nBond\nDipole moment [D]\n\n\n\n\nC–C\n0\n\n\nC–N\n0.22\n\n\nO–H\n1.51\n\n\nF–H\n1.94\n\n\nN=O\n2.0\n\n\n\nSimilarly, molecules have different dipole moments depending on their structure:\n\n\n\nMolecule\nDipole moment [D]\n\n\n\n\nHexane\n0\n\n\nWater\n1.85\n\n\nEthanol\n1.7\n\n\nAcetone\n2.9\n\n\n\nThe dipole moment of a molecule is measured by the displacement of two charges \\(\\pm q\\) from each other:\n\\[\n\\vec{u} = q \\vec{l}.\n\\]\nIts direction is from the negative to the positive charge. The dipole creates an electric field given by\n\\[\n\\vec{E} = \\frac{3(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\hat{r}) \\hat{r} - \\vec{u}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon r^3},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{r} = \\vec{r}/|r|\\). The dipole self-energy, or the energy required to create the dipole in a solvent, is given by\n\\[\n\\mu^{0} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon} \\left[ \\frac{q^2}{2a} + \\frac{q^2}{2a} - \\frac{q^2}{l} \\right].\n\\]\nFor \\(l = 2a\\), this simplifies to\n\\[\n\\mu^0 = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon a} = \\frac{u^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon l^3}\n\\]\nwhich shows a similar dependence of the chemical potential on the dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\) as in the case of a single charge. As a result, the solubility of polar molecules also depends on the dielectric constant in a manner similar to that of ionic solubility.\nThe plot below illustrates the electric field of a dipole:\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\n \n# generate grid\nx=np.linspace(-2, 2, 32)\ny=np.linspace(-2, 2, 32)\nx, y=np.meshgrid(x, y)\n \ndef E(q, a, x, y):\n    return q*(x-a[0])/((x-a[0])**2+(y-a[1])**2)**(1.5), \\\n        q*(y-a[1])/((x-a[0])**2+(y-a[1])**2)**(1.5)\n \n# calculate vector field\nEx1, Ey1=E(-1, [-0.1, 0], x, y)\nEx2, Ey2=E(1, [0.1, 0], x, y)\nEx=Ex1+Ex2\nEy=Ey1+Ey2\n\nE_max=5\nE=np.sqrt(Ex**2+Ey**2)\n\nEx.flat[E.flat[:]&gt;E_max]=np.nan\nEy.flat[E.flat[:]&gt;E_max]=np.nan\n# plot vecor field\nplt.quiver(x, y, Ex/E, Ey/E, pivot='middle', headwidth=3, headlength=5,scale=40)\nplt.xlabel('$x$')\nplt.ylabel('$y$')\nplt.title('dipole field')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Ion–dipole interaction\nThe interaction energy of a dipole with a charge can be calculated by\n\\[\nw(r)=-\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon}\\left[\\frac{1}{r-\\frac{1}{2}l \\cos(\\theta)}-\\frac{1}{r+\\frac{1}{2}l \\cos(\\theta)}\\right]=-\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^2}\\cos(\\theta)=-uE\\cos(\\theta),\n\\label{eq:energy}\n\\]\nwhere the last two equations are assuming that the distance between both objects \\(r\\) is much larger than the extent of the dipole \\(l\\) itself. From the last equation, we see that the interaction can be either attractive or repulsive. An angle \\(θ=0^°\\) results in an attractive interaction, while \\(θ=180^°\\) yields repulsive interaction. Using a single charge (e.g., an \\(\\mathrm{Na^+}\\) ion) and a dipole of \\(u=1.85\\, \\mathrm{D}\\) (water molecule) results in an interaction energy of about \\(39\\, k_\\mathrm{B}T\\).

    "text": "12.1 Interactions involving polar molecules\nMany molecules exhibit a dipole or even higher moments due to the fact that the charges are not evenly distributed over the molecular structure. Some of the atoms exhibit a stronger tendency to accept charges than others. This is typically measured by electronegativity and provides an idea of whether atoms rather donate or accept a charge when binding to other atoms. While homo-atomic bonds therefore do not have dipole moments, hetero-atomic bonds do (see table).\nThe dipole moment of a molecule is measured by the displacement of two charges \\(±q\\) from each other:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\vec{u}=q\\vec{l}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIts direction is from the negative to the positive side. It creates an electric field that is given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\vec{E}=\\frac{3(\\vec{u}\\cdot \\hat{r})\\hat{r}-\\vec{u}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^{3}},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{r}=\\vec{r}/|r|\\).

The result is a similar dependence of the solubility on the dielectric function.\nThe plot below shows the electric field of a dipole:",

We will will consider a much simpler approach at the beginning and later study the more general approach by McLachlan.\nConsider first two atoms which have\nDepite this fact, the atoms may have an instantaneous dipole, which is causing and induced dipole in the other atom. Similarly, the second atom may cause a corresponding dipole in the first atom as well. This will effectively lead to an attractive interaction, which carries the spirit of the dispersion interaction. We can put that into a simple and very crude model based on the most basic semi-classical description of an atom.\nThis atom may consist of an electron and proton, which are separated by a distance \\(a_0\\), which corresponds to the Bohr radius. In this atom, the Coulomb interaction is given by\n\\[\nE_\\mathrm{pot}=\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0}\n\\]\nThis potential energy corresponds for an hydrogen atom to the ionization potential \\(I=13.6\\) eV. To ionize the atom, we can use electromagnetic radiation of the frequency \\(\\nu=3.3\\times 10 ^{15}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\). Thus, in principle a photon of energy \\(h\\nu=2.2\\times 10^{-18}\\) J would be sufficient to ionize the atom.\nAccordingly, we have\n\\[h \\nu= \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0}\\]\nor we can write, that the Bohr radius of the electron orbit is given by\n\\[a_0=\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 h\\nu}\\].\nIn this simple classical picture the atom has an instantaneous dipole which corresponds to \\(u=a_0 e\\). This dipole creates a dipole field, that induces a dipole in the second atom. Using our previous findings for the dipole - induced dipole interaction yields\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw(r)=-\\frac{u^2 \\alpha_0}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}=-\\frac{(a_0 e)^2 \\alpha_0}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_0\\) is the electronic polarizability \\(\\alpha_0=4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0^3\\). The latter gives\n\\[a_0^{2}=\\frac{\\alpha_0}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0}\\]\nfrom which we finally find the interaction energy\n\\[w(r)=-\\frac{a_0^2 e^2 \\alpha_0}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}=-\\frac{\\alpha_0^2}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2}\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0 }\\frac{1}{r^6}\\]\nor\n\\[w(r)=-\\frac{\\alpha_0^2 h\\nu}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}\\]\nThis simple semi-classical description corresponds to the result London (up to a factor of 3/4) obtained with a quantum-mechanical pertubation theory, which is\n\\[\nw(r)=-\\frac{C_\\mathrm{disp}}{r^6}=-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{\\alpha_0^2 h\\nu}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}=-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{\\alpha_0^2I}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}\n\\]\nSo far, we assumed that both molecules have the same polarizability and thus are of the same type. If this is not the case, the interaction energy is given by\n\\[\nw(r)=-\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\alpha_{01},\\alpha_{02}}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 r^6}\\frac{I_1 I_2}{I_1+I_2}\n\\]\nWhile the theory above provides us only with some idea about the dispersion interaction, we can now summarize all three contributions to the van der Waals interaction\n\\[\nw_\\mathrm{vdW}(r)=-\\underbrace{\\frac{u_{1}^{2} u_{2}^{2}}{3 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\right)^{2} r^{6}}}_{\\text{Keesom}}-\\underbrace{\\frac{u_{1}^{2} \\alpha_{02}+u_{2}^{2} \\alpha_{01}}{\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\right)^{2} r^{6}}}_{\\text {Debye }}-\\underbrace{\\frac{3 h\\nu_1\\nu_2 \\alpha_{01} \\alpha_{02}}{\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\right)^{2} 2(\\nu_1+\\nu_2)r^{6}}}_{\\text {London} }\n\\]\nor simply\n\\[\nw_\\mathrm{vdW}(r)=-\\frac{C_\\mathrm{vdW}}{r^6}=-\\frac{C_\\mathrm{Debye}+C_\\mathrm{Keesom}+C_\\mathrm{disp}}{r^6}\n\\]\nThe individual contributions have different strength, but it is not difficult to see that the dispersion interaction is typically the biggest one as shown in the table below. The reason for that is the ionization potential and we will address this issue later in the section of the McLachlan theory.",

In fact, the last part is the zero-frequency part of the dispersion energy. Comparing the magnitudes of \\(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\\) and \\(h v\\), we can see that the zero-frequency contribution to the dispersion energy is negligible.\n\n\n\n15.1.2 Optical Frequency Contribution\nThe lowest legal frequency \\(h v_{1}=2 \\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\approx 0.16 \\mathrm{eV}\\). The permanent dipoles cannot respond to such high frequency, therefore the dipole polarizability has no effect on the dispersion energy at optical frequencies. The electronic polarizability govern the dispersion energy at such frequencies. We first consider \\(\\epsilon_{3}=1\\), that the 2 molecules are in vacuum.\nThe summation in the original equation can be estimated using continuous integral at optical frequencies, if temperature is very low. Since \\(h \\mathrm{~d} \\nu=2 \\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\mathrm{~d} n\\), we can rewrite the integral from \\(n=1\\) to\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw_{\\mathrm{vdw}}(\\nu&gt;0)=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi} \\frac{6}{\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\right)^{2} r^{6}} \\int_{\\nu_{1}}^{\\infty} \\alpha_{1}(i v) \\alpha_{2}(i v) \\mathrm{d} v\n\\end{equation}\\]\nUsing the approximate form of the polarizability\n\\[\\alpha(i v)=\\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{\\left[1+\\left(v / v_{\\mathrm{I}}\\right)^{2}\\right]}\\]\nand \\(\\epsilon_3=1\\) we end up at\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw(\\nu&gt;0, r)=-\\frac{3 \\alpha_{01} \\alpha_{02}}{2\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\right)^{2} r^{6}} \\frac{h v_{\\mathrm{I} 1} v_{\\mathrm{I} 2}}{v_{\\mathrm{I} 1}+v_{\\mathrm{I} 2}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is finally the London form of dispersion energy. Now we know why this interaction is called “dispersion”. The largest contribution to the energy comes from the range where \\(v\\) is close to \\(v_{\\mathrm{I}}\\). Since \\(v_{\\mathrm{I}}\\) is usually in UV range, such interaction is dominated by the polarizabilities from Vis to UV frequencies. As the polarizability and permittivity are closely related to the dispersion of light, it is not hard to understand why it is originally coined as “dispersion interaction”.",

    "text": "16.1 Interaction Between Macroscopic Bodies\nThe equations that we derived before are essentially valid between small objects at distances larger than their size. If objects become macroscopic, we have to consider the interaction of all components of a body with all components of the second body. To calculate those interactions, we will assume that all interactions are additive, while we know that this is not completely true for van der Waals forces.\nWe will generalize also our law of interaction of the individual units to\n\\[w(r)=-\\frac{C}{r^n}\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the interaction constant. \\(C\\) comprises all additional constants in the interaction law. In the McLachlan case the constant \\(C\\) would be given as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}}(r)=-\\underbrace{\\frac{6 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\right)^{2}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{}^{\\prime} \\frac{\\alpha_{1}\\left(i v_{n}\\right) \\alpha_{2}\\left(i v_{n}\\right)}{\\epsilon_{3}^{2}\\left(i v_{n}\\right)}}_{C} \\frac{1}{r^{6}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe start by evaluating the interaction of\na) a single molecule with a wall\nAccording to the image above we see that the single molecule interacts with all molecules in a tiny volume element at a distance \\(r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\) in the same way. This cylindral volume is given by\n\\[2\\pi x dx dz\\]\nand contains, based on the number density \\(\\rho\\) of molecules in the wall and amount of \\(2\\pi x dx dz\\rho\\) molecules.

This is a very general results, that the interactions law, which were obtained for point-like objects turn now into distance dependences that are more complex due to the extended shape of macroscopic bodies.\nb) Interaction of a sphere with a wall\nIf we now turn now to a sphere in front of a wall, we have to add up all contributions of molecules in the sphere, which are at a certain distance \\(D\\). Each of these molecules contributes according to a), so we have to add interactions of slices of the sphere, which are at a distance \\(D+z\\).\nAccording to the figure, the radius of the slices is given by\n\\[x^2=(2R-z)z\\]\nwhich gives a volume of the slice, which is \\(\\pi x^2 dz=\\pi (2R-z)z dz\\) that finally gives the number of molecules \\(\\rho \\pi (2R-z)dz\\) with \\(\\rho\\) being the number density of wall and sphere.

This is again a general result for the interaction for the interaction of bodies at small distances.\nIf the seperation of sphere and wall is much larger than the sphere itself \\(D\\gg R\\), we can approximate the above integral with\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nw(D)=-\\frac{2\\pi C \\rho (4\\pi R^3 \\rho/3 )}{(n-2)(n-3)D^{n-3}}\n\\end{equation}\\]",

    "text": "20.1 Translational Diffusion\nFor describing the transport and the dynamics of objects we need to write down some basic relations that will later gover our analysis. One is of course the continuity equation essentially stating that in the absence of sources or sinks, material flowing into a system has to move out of it as well. The flow is characterized by a current density \\(\\textbf{j}\\). The flow through a surface is then goverened by the normal components of the flow with respect to the surface having a normal \\(\\textbf{n}\\).\nThe total flow through a surface is then\n\\[\n\\int_{S}\\textbf{j}\\cdot \\textbf{n}dS\n\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is now some quantity (a density, probability density or other) that can beb transporeted through a surface or exist inside a volume surrounded by an area, the total amount inside the volume is given by\n\\[\n\\int_{V}f\\cdot dV\n\\]\nThe change of the total content inside the volume with time is then\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{V}f\\cdot dV=\\int_{V}\\frac{df}{dt}\\cdot dV\n\\]\nThis then yields the continuity equation\n\\[\n\\frac{df}{dt}+\\nabla \\textbf{j}=0\\tag{Continuity Equation}\n\\]\nIf we specifically consider the number density \\(n\\) and insert this as \\(f\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}+\\nabla (n\\textbf{v})=0 \\tag{Continuity Equation for n}\n\\]\nThe continuity equation states that the amount of the quantity (such as mass, charge, or energy) within a defined system can only change if there is a flow of that quantity into or out of the system. More generally, the continuity equation may have a source term on the right side instead of the \\(0\\) when there is a production or destruction of the quantity in the volume.\nAs the next step, we would like to obtain an equation, which tells us about the flow of the density of objects, due to their Brownian motion. We consider a vertical wall of area \\(A\\), which separates two regions. There are \\(N(x)\\) on the left and \\(N(x+\\Delta x)\\) on the right of area \\(A\\).\nWe can calculate the number of particles that goes through the area from the difference of the number of particles on the left and on the right side and divided by the area where the particles go through and the time \\(\\tau\\) they need to go through that this is the current density \\(j\\)\n\\[\nj=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{N(x+\\Delta x)-N(x))}{A\\tau}\n\\]\nThe fact, the one half makes sure that we consider only 50% of the particles on the left side going through the area while the other 50% go further to the left.\nWe can also rewrite the number of particles in terms of the density \\(n\\)\n\\[\nn(x)\\equiv \\frac{N(x)}{A\\Delta x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta x\\) and a span a volume from which the particles travel through the area \\(A\\). With the help of the density, we can replace the number of particles in the equation before and obtain an equation, which only contains the density of the particles.\n\\[\nj=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{n(x+\\Delta x)A\\Delta x-n(x)A\\Delta x)}{A\\tau}\n\\]\n\\[\nj=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\tau}\\frac{n(x+\\Delta x)-n(x)}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nYou can see that the area a drops out of the equation and we can sub summarise the term with \\(\\Delta x^2\\) and \\(\\tau\\) into a new coefficient, which is the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\). We just arrived at the DA fusion law, which is fixed first law, which tells us that the current density is proportional to the diffusion coefficient times the negative gradient of the density.\n\\[\nj=-D\\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\nD=\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\tau}\n\\]\nIn 3 dimensions this yields\n\\[\n\\textbf{j}=-D\\nabla n \\tag{1. Ficks Law}\n\\]\nwhich we can also combine with the continuity equation to give\n\\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}=D\\nabla^2n \\tag{2. Ficks Law}\n\\]\nwhich describes the time evolution of the density \\(n\\). This type of diffusion equation is found for many transport problems. We just have to exchange the density \\(n\\) by other densities:",

The force is given by a potential gradient.\n\\[\nF=-\\frac{dU}{dx}\n\\]\nIf the force, for example, acts on a colloid in a liquid, a steady speed of the colloid will appear after a while, when the force is balanced by the frictional force in the liquid, which amounts to \\(F_{s}=-6\\pi\\eta R v\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the colloid, \\(\\eta\\) is the viscosity of the liquid. The steady speed of the colloid in the liquid under a force \\(F\\) is therefore given as\n\\[\nv=-\\frac{1}{\\xi}\\frac{dU}{dx}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi=6\\pi\\eta R\\) is the friction coefficient for a sphere. Therefore we have an additional current density due to the external force, which is given by \\(j=nv\\) and therefore the total current density is given by\n\\[\nj=-D \\frac{dn}{dx}-\\frac{n}{\\xi}\\frac{dU}{dx}\n\\]\nAs we will see later, the diffusion coefficient can be als written as \\(D=k_{B}T/\\xi\\), which results in\n\\[\nj=-\\frac{1}{\\xi}\\left( k_B T \\frac{dn}{dx} +n \\frac{dU}{dx} \\right )\n\\]\nusing\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(n(x))=\\frac{1}{n(x)}\\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\nwe find\n\\[\nj=-\\frac{1}{\\xi}n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\underbrace{k_B T \\ln(x)+U }_{\\text{chemical\\, potential}} \\right)=-\\frac{1}{\\xi}n\\frac{d\\mu}{dx}\n\\]\nwhere we recognize the term in the bracket as chemical potential. In general, an inhomogeneous chemical potential drives currents in a system. This is the general version of Fick’s first law, while Ficks second law results in\n\\[\n\\frac{d n}{d t}=-\\frac{d j}{d x}=\\frac{1}{\\xi} \\frac{d}{d x}\\left(k_B T \\frac{d n}{d x}+n \\frac{d U}{dx}\\right)\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}=\\nabla \\left (D \\nabla n +n\\frac{\\textbf{F}}{\\xi}\\right ) \\tag{Smoluchowski equation}\n\\]\nThis may be even further generalized and leads to the Fokker-Planck-Equation, which we leave out here in the discussion.\nThe time dependet diffusion equation\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} n\\left(\\vec{r}, t \\mid \\vec{r}_0, t_0\\right)=D \\nabla^2 n\\left(\\vec{r}, t \\mid \\vec{r}_0, t_0\\right)\n\\]\ncan be solved for given boundary and initial conditions. For the following\n\\[\nn\\left(\\vec{r}, t \\rightarrow t_0\\left|\\vec{r}_0, t_0\\right|=\\delta\\left(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_0\\right)\\right. \\tag{initial condition}\n\\]\n\\[\nn\\left(|\\vec{r}| \\rightarrow \\infty, t \\mid \\vec{r}_0, t_0\\right)=0 \\tag{boundary condition}\n\\]\nwe obtain the Greens function \\[\nn(\\vec{r},t|\\vec{r}_{0},t_{0})=\\frac{1}{(4\\pi D(t-t_0))^{3/2}}e^{-\\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_{0})^2}{4D(t-t_0)}} \\tag{Greens function}\n\\]\nfor the diffusion equation and the corresponding boundary conditions. The Greens function is the impulse response. With the help of it, new solutions for any initial condition can be constructed. Lets assume we have an initial condition given by\n\\[\nn\\left(\\vec{r}, t \\rightarrow 0\\right)=f\\left(\\vec{v}_0\\right)\n\\]\nthen the time dependent solution is a superposition of the Greens function solutions\n\\[\nn(\\vec{r}, t)=\\int  n\\left(\\vec{r}, t \\mid \\vec{r}_0, t_0\\right) f\\left(\\vec{r}_0 \\right)dr_0\n\\]\nLet is quickly consider the solution in 1 dimension and derive some simple properties of it. The first is the mean position of the density. The mean position is calculated by\n\\[\n\\langle x\\rangle=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} x \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}} \\cdot e^{\\frac{-\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2}{4 D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}} d x\n\\]\nand the result states\n\\[\n\\langle x\\rangle=x_0\n\\]\nthat it is constant, i.e. the initial position is staionary even though the particles spread in space. This is of course expected as there is no drift in the system to one or the other direction. As the particles still spread in space, the change is in the second moment of the distribution, which is the variance calculated by\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2\\right\\rangle=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2 n(x, t) d x = 2Dt\n\\]\nThe result of this is corresponds to the mean squared displacement of a single particle. The variance of the distribution grows linearly in time and the coefficient characterizing the spread of the particles is the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\). The law obtained here, can be generalized to \\(d=3\\) dimensions by\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\left(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0\\right)^2\\right\\rangle=2dDt=6Dt\n\\]\nA mean distance travelled is therefore related to the square root of time. This diffusion processes are rapid at short distances but very slow for largedistance as can be seen from the table below.\n\n\n\nTable Diffusion\n\n\n\n\n20.1.2 Application: Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching\n\nOne application of our Greens frunction approach that is frequently used in studying biological materials is Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching or short FRAP.\nInitial condition:\n\\[\nn\\left(x, t_0\\right)=\\Theta(-a-x)+\\Theta(x-a)\n\\]\nBoundary Condition\n\\[\n\\lim _{|x| \\rightarrow \\infty} n(x, t)=0\n\\]\nGreens Function\n\\[\nn\\left(x,t | x_0, t_0\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}} e^{-\\frac{\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2}{4D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\n\\]\nTherefore the total solution\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn(x, t)=&\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} d x_0 n\\left(x, t \\mid x_0, t_0\\right) \\cdot[\\Theta (-a-x)+\\Theta(x-a)]\\\\\n=& \\int_{-\\infty}^{-a} d x_0 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D \\left(t-t_0\\right)}} e^{-\\frac{\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2}{4 D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\\\\\n=& \\int_{a}^{\\infty} d x_0 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}} e^{-\\frac{\\left(x-x_0\\right)^2}{4 D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe solution of the integration is\n\\[\nn(x, t)=1-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\operatorname{erf}\\left[\\frac{x+a}{2 \\sqrt{D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\\right]-\\operatorname{erf}\\left[\\frac{x-a}{2 \\sqrt{D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\\right]\\right)\n\\]\nwith \\(\\mathrm{erf}\\) being the error function\n\\[\n\\mathrm{erf}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{-x}^x e^{-t^2} d t=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^x e^{-t^2} d t\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also characterize the amount of density in the bleached region as a function of time. This gives a single time trace, which we ca analyze to obtain the diffusion coefficient\n\\[\nN\\left(t, t_0\\right)= \\int_{-a}^{+a}  n(x, t)\\, d x\n\\]\nThe integration of the previously obtained density then results in\n\\[\nN\\left(t, t_0\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}{a \\sqrt{\\pi}}\\left(1-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{a^2}{D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}\\right]\\right)+1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left[\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{D\\left(t-t_0\\right)}}\\right]\n\\]\nwhich is plotted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;function __main__.plot_function(D)&gt;",

The time dependent solution of the density \\(n\\) at the surface of the sphere can therefore be expressed as a sum over all surface harmonics with time dependent amplitudes \\(A_{\\operatorname{lm}}\\left(t, \\Omega_0, t_0\\right)\\), which depend on the initial distribution at \\(t_0\\).\n\\[\nn\\left(\\Omega, t \\mid \\Omega_0, t_0\\right)=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^{+l} A_{l m}\\left(t, \\Omega_0, t_0\\right) Y_l^m(\\Omega)\n\\]\nTo obtain a solution for the amplitudes, we insert the series into the diffusion equation to yield\n\\[\n\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^{+l} \\frac{\\partial A_{l m}}{\\partial t} Y_l^m=-\\frac{1}{\\tau_R}\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^l l(l+1)  A_{l m} Y_l^m\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_{\\mathrm{rot}}=1/\\tau_{R}\\) is the rotational diffusion coefficient. Due to the orthogonality of the surface harmonics, this finally yields\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial A_{l m}}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{l(l+1)}{\\tau_{R}} A_{l m}\n\\]\nfor each value of the integer number \\(l\\) and \\(m\\). This is solved by an exponential function\n\\[\nA_{\\operatorname{lm}}\\left(t \\mid \\Omega_0, t_0\\right)=e^{-l(l+1) \\frac{\\left(t-t_0\\right)}{\\tau_R}} \\quad a_{lm}\\left(\\Omega_0\\right)\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients \\(a_{lm}\\) are determined by the initial conditions.\nThe final solution is therefore\n\\[\nn\\left(\\Omega, t \\mid \\Omega_0, t_0\\right)=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^l e^{-l(l+1) \\frac{\\left(t-t_0\\right)}{\\tau_R}} a_{l_m}\\left(\\Omega_0\\right) Y_l^m \\tag{rotational diffusion}\n\\]\nA more specific solution can be obtained by assuming that there is a delta function for the density \\(n\\) as the initial condition, i.e. \n\\[\nn\\left(\\Omega, t_0|  \\Omega_0, t_0\\right)=\\delta\\left(\\Omega-\\Omega_0\\right)\n\\]\nThe delta function can be expressed in speherical coordinates as\n\\[\n\\delta\\left(\\Omega-\\Omega_0\\right)=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^l Y_{l m}^*\\left(\\Omega_0\\right) Y_{l n}(\\Omega)\n\\]\nan yields\n\\[\na_{lm}\\left(\\Omega_0\\right)=Y_{l m}\\left(\\Omega_0\\right)\n\\]\nand this finally\n\\[\nn(\\Omega, t| \\Omega_0, t_0)=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-l}^k e^{-l(l+1) \\frac{(t-t_0)} {\\tau_R}} Y_{lm}^*\\left(\\Omega_0\\right) Y_{l m}(\\Omega)\n\\]\nAnalyzing this equation we see that the amplitudes decay exponentially with a time constant \\(\\tau_{R}/(l(l+1))\\). The largest time constant, i.e. the time constant that prevails at long times is \\(\\tau_R/2\\), while the dynamic behavior at short times can be multi-exponential.\n\n20.2.1 NMR Spectroscopy/Dielectric Relaxation\nThe results have some immediate consquences for the analysis of experimental data coming from dielectric spectroscopy or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Both techniques are very common for studying soft matter, as they address either molecular electric dipoles or nuclear magnetic dipoles, which respond to a perturbation by an external field through various processes, among them an orientational diffusion.\nFor dielectric spectroscopy one measures a dielectric polarization, i.e. a projection of dipoles onto an axis given by an electric field. Similarly NMR uses the projection of magnetic dipoles (nuclear spins) to the magnetic field direction to create a magnetization. If the dipole makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the corresponding field, then the projection of the dipole is \\(\\mu \\cos(\\theta)\\), which is responsible for the polarization/magnetization. What is probed by NMR or dielectric spectroscopy is therefore the relaxation of that cosine term.\nIn the sum of spherical surface harmonics, this is actually the term with \\(l=1\\), which is accompanied with the first Legendre polynomial:\n\\[\nP_1^0=P_0 \\cos (\\theta) \\quad l=1\n\\]\nSo both techniques would probe the first Legendre polynomial, but\n\\[\n\\left\\langle P_{1}^0\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int d \\Omega P_0 \\cos (\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nThis is because the dynamics of the dipoles is uncorrelated and doing Brownian motion. Yet, you can have a look at the dynamics if you calculate the autocorrelation function\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\langle P_1^0(t) P_1^{0, *}\\left(t_0\\right)\\right)=& P_0^2 \\int d \\Omega \\int d \\Omega_0 \\cos (\\theta) \\cos \\left(\\theta_0\\right) n\\left(\\Omega, t |\\Omega_0 ,t_0\\right) n_0\\left(\\Omega_0\\right)\\\\\n= & \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} P_0^2 \\sum_{m=1}^l e^{-l(l+1) \\frac{t-t_0}{\\tau_R}}\\left|C_{10 l m}\\right|^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere the \\(C_{10 l m}\\) are again defined by the initial conditions. So if these are delta functions, one quickly finds that\n\\[\n\\left\\langle P_3(t) P_3^*(t_0)\\right\\rangle=\\frac{4 \\pi}{3} P_0^2 e^{-2\\left(t-t_0\\right) /\\tau_R}\n\\]\nSo the correlation function decay with a time constant that is half the rotational diffusion time due to the projection of the dipole to a certain direction. Here are some more details on measurements based on NMR, even though focused on magnetic resonance imaging.",

Thus we can only refer to the statistical properties (e.g. its moments) when solving the Langevin equation. Therefore also not analytical solution for the position can be written down, only average proerties over an ensemble or over time (given ergodicity).\nThe first moment (the mean) of the fluctuating force gives\n\\[\n\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t) \\rangle =0\n\\]\ni.e. there is no net force acting on average on the particle considered.

Using our previous result for the mean squared velocity, i.e. \\(\\langle v^2\\rangle =3k_B T\\) we obtain after integrating over time\n\\[\n\\langle \\vec{r}\\cdot \\vec{v}\\rangle =C\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right)+ \\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi\\eta R}\n\\]\nUsing the initial condition \\(\\vec{r}(t=0)=0\\) this gives\n\\[\n\\langle \\vec{r}\\cdot \\vec{v}\\rangle =\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi\\eta R}\\left (1 -\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nA second integration over time of \\(\\langle \\vec{r}\\cdot \\vec{v}\\rangle\\) can be carried out using\n\\[\n\\langle \\vec{r}\\cdot \\vec{v}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle r^2\\rangle\n\\]\nand we finally obtain the mean squared displacement\n\\[\n\\langle r^2\\rangle =\\frac{k_B T}{\\pi \\eta R}\\left [ t-\\tau_{mr}\\left ( 1-\\exp\\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\right )\\right ]\n\\]\nThis is the mean squared displacement for an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, a process, which has a persistence for a certain time and then is randomized. It described the transition from the ballistic to diffusive regime for a Brownian particle except that it misses the hydrodynamic memory in the intermediate regime.\n\nWe can look at different limits of the process with respect to the momentum relaxation time, ie.\n1) long time limits: \\(t\\gg \\tau_{mr}\\)\nIn this regime, the exponential function has already decayed to zero and we obtain\n\\[\n\\langle r^{2}\\rangle =6Dt\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\nD=\\frac{k_B T}{6\\pi\\eta R}\n\\]\n1) short times: \\(t\\approx \\tau_{mr}\\)\nFor short times, we can expand the exponential function up to second order\n\\[\n\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\approx 1-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}+\\frac{t^2}{\\tau_{mr}^2}\n\\]\nto obtain for\n\\[\nt-\\tau_{mr}\\left ( 1-\\exp\\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\right )\\approx \\frac{t^2}{2\\tau_{mr}}\n\\]\nand for the mean squared displacement\n\\[\n\\langle r^2 \\rangle \\propto t^2\n\\]\nwhich is the result we expect for ballistic motion. Between both regimes, the MSD could be complicated as the short time motion starts a hydrodynamic flux in the environment which is influencing the particle motion again. These hydrodynamic memory effects cause the so called long time tails in the mean squared displacement. The Langevin equation in one dimension then reads like\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nM^{\\prime} \\ddot{x}(t)=\n-6 \\pi \\eta R \\dot{x}(t)-6 R^{2} \\sqrt{\\pi \\rho_{f} \\eta} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(t-t^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1 / 2} \\ddot{x}\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime} -\\nabla U+\\zeta(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand contains the effective mass of the colloidal \\(M^{\\prime}\\), the fluid density \\(\\rho_f\\) and the external potential \\(U\\). The full MSD for a colloidal particle is displayed in the figure below as measured for example in an optical tweezer in the Molecular Nanophotonics group. Note that the MSD axis goes down to \\(10^{-21}\\, \\mathrm{m}\\), which corresponds to 30 picometer displacement, which is far below the size of a hydrodgen atom.\n\n\n\nMSD\n\n\nWhile we so far only know that \\(\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t) \\rangle =0\\), we also know that there must be a certain magnitude of the random force that is connected to the temperature of the sample. The short time autocorrelation of the noise should be of the type\n\\[\n\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t_1)\\cdot \\vec{\\zeta}(t_2) \\rangle =A\\delta (t_1-t_2)\n\\]\nstating the the forces are truly random and only correlated, when the times conincide. We would like to determine the prefactor \\(A\\) now. We can write down the Langevin equation with\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{v}(t)=-\\frac{1}{\\tau_{mr}}\\vec{v}(t)+\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\zeta}(t)\n\\]\nand multiply by \\(\\exp(t/\\tau_{mr})\\), which results in\n\\[\n\\exp\\left (\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{v}(t)+\\frac{1}{\\tau_{mr}}\\exp\\left (\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\vec{v}(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}\\left (\\exp\\left (\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\vec{v}(t) \\right )=\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right )\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\zeta}(t)\n\\]\nIntegrating both sides of the two right parts over time results in\n\\[\n\\vec{v}(t)=\\vec{v}(0)\\exp \\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )+\\exp \\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )\\frac{1}{m}\\int_0^t \\exp \\left (\\frac{t'}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )\\vec{\\zeta}(t')dt'\n\\]\nwhich is the time evolution of the velocity. To obtain \\(\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t_1)\\cdot \\vec{\\zeta}(t_2) \\rangle\\), we need to calculate the product of the velocity at two times and take the ensemble average. The calculation is essentially a writing exercise which at the end yields three different terms.\nThe first term contains\n\\[\n\\langle v_0^2 \\rangle \\exp\\left (-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )\\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nwhich decays to zero for long times. The second term contains two mixed terms of the type\n\\[\n\\frac{v_0}{m}\\exp\\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right ) \\int \\ldots \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nwhich also decay to zero for long times. The last term contains\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t}dt' \\int_{-\\infty}^{t}dt''\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t-t'}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t-t''}{\\tau_{mr}} \\right )\\langle \\vec{\\zeta}(t')\\vec{\\zeta}(t'')\\rangle\n\\]\nwhcih is the only nonzero term. Inserting our initial assumption \\(\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t_1)\\cdot \\vec{\\zeta}(t_2) \\rangle =A\\delta (t_1-t_2)\\) results in the mean squared velocity\n\\[\n\\langle v^2\\rangle =\\frac{A}{2m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t}dt' \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{2(t-t')}{\\tau_{mr}}\\right)=\\frac{A\\tau_{mr}}{2m^2}\n\\]\nSince the velocity also has to comply with equipartition, i.e. \n\\[\n\\langle v^2\\rangle=\\frac{k_B T}{m}=\\frac{A\\tau_{mr}}{2m^2}\n\\]\nwe find\n\\[\nA=2\\gamma k_B T\n\\]\nwith \\(\\gamma=6\\pi\\eta R\\) or\n\\[\n\\langle\\vec{\\zeta}(t_1)\\cdot \\vec{\\zeta}(t_2) \\rangle =2\\gamma k_B T\\delta (t_1-t_2)\n\\]\nwhich is a very fundamental result. It states that the fluctuating force \\(\\vec{\\zeta}(t)\\) are related to the viscous forces expressed by the friction coefficient \\(\\gamma\\). This makes sensse, since the friction forces must dissipate energy into heat. The motion would thus come to a rest if heat and dynamics would be decoupled. The law we obtained is thus stateing the dissipated energy goes back again into kinetic energy. This is the statement of the fluctuation dissipation theorem,",

On the left side is the imaginary part of a response function or susceptibility \\(\\chi\\), which is connected to the dissipation.

So the amplitude of a fluctuation at a certain frequency is connected to the dissipation in equilibrium.\n\n21.2.1 Damped Driven Harmonic Oscillator\nWe would like to have a look at the FDT using a 1d damped driven oscillator given by the following equation\n\\[\nm\\ddot{x}+\\gamma \\dot{x}+kx=F(t)\n\\]\nwith \\(k\\) being the spring constant of the harmonic potential and \\(\\gamma\\) the friction coefficient. Solving this differential equation yields for the amplitude of the oscillation at a certain driving frequency of \\(F(t)\\)\n\\[\nx_{\\omega}=\\frac{1}{k-m\\omega^2-i\\gamma \\omega}F_{\\omega}\n\\]\nwhich is clearly a linear response relation as amplitude and force dependent lineraly on each other. The amplitude of the force is actually the amplitude of the fluctuating force, we obtained for the Langevin equation before, e.g. \\(F_{\\omega}=A=\\sqrt{2\\gamma k_B T}\\). As this is white noise, the amplitude at different frequencies is the same.The term converting the force into an amplitude is the response function\n\\[\n\\chi(\\omega)=\\frac{1}{k-m\\omega^2-i\\gamma \\omega} \\tag{response function}\n\\]\nwhich can be split into real and imaginary part, i.e. \\(\\chi=\\chi'(\\omega)+i\\chi'' (\\omega)\\).

This is the frequency spectrum of the positional and speed fluctuations of a Brownian particle. This is exactly what is found in an optical tweezer for a Brownian particle at high frequencies. At lower frequencies the particle bounces from the harmonic potential and the motion of the colloid is restricted.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\chi''(\\omega)}{\\omega}=\\frac{\\gamma}{k^2+(\\omega \\gamma)^2}=\\frac{1}{2k_B T}\\langle |x_{\\omega}|^2\\rangle\n\\]\nFrom this follows the power spectral density of the positional fluctuations in an optical tweezers\n\\[\n\\langle |x_{\\omega}|^2\\rangle =\\frac{2k_B T \\gamma}{k^2}\\frac{1}{1+(\\omega/\\omega_0)^2}\n\\]\nHere \\(\\omega_0=k/\\gamma\\) is a particular frequency at which the \\(1/\\omega^2\\) dependence of the power spectrum turns into a plateau at small frequencies.

    "text": "22.1 Navier Stokes Equation\nWe obtain a force density from the above equations if we multiply the above derived velocity change with the mass density \\(\\rho\\) of the fluid. This force density is the result of all possible forces that are present in the system. We thus have to consider possible forces on a volume element.\na) We would like to simplify our considerations by assuming an incompressibility of the liquid, i.e.\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}=0 \\tag{incompressibility}\n\\]\nb) One of the causes of a flow could be a pressure acting on the surface of a volume element\nIf the pressure \\(p\\) acts on the surface we have for a surface element \\(\\delta S\\) with a normal vector \\(\\hat{n}\\) a force \\(-\\hat{n}p\\delta S\\) on the surface element. If we integrate the force over the whole surface we can write\n\\[\n-\\oint p\\hat{n}\\delta S = -\\int \\nabla p dV\n\\]\nstating the the integral of the pressure over the whole surface should amount for the volume integral (over the volume enclosed by the surface) of the gradient pressure. Thus the net force cause by a pressure gradient is \\(-\\nabla p dV\\) and the pressure gradient is just the force density.\n\\[\n-\\nabla p \\tag{pressure force density}\n\\]\nc) Additionally, flow may be caused by external forces, like gravity (or others)\nThe force density by an external force, like gravity is just given by\n\\[\n\\rho \\vec{g} \\tag{external force density }\n\\]\nThe sum of these components of the force density make up the Euler equation\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\rho \\frac{D\\vec{u}}{Dt}=\\rho \\left [\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} +(\\vec{u}\\nabla)\\vec{u}\\right ]=-\\nabla p + \\rho \\vec{g} \\tag{Euler equation}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Euler equation describes the flow of ideal fluids due to pressure gradients or external forces. It is, however, only valid for ideal fluids with no internal friction. Thus, it essentially describes the flow of dilute gases or superfluids like superfluid Helium.\nTo go beyond that limitation, we have to introduce frction into the equations. Since this is a good occasion, we will introduce the stress tensor at the same time, which is expressing all possible force on a volume element of a fluid.\nd) Introduce internal friction\nLet’s consider the following system with two fluid sheets, which only have a constant velocity component along the x-direction, i.e. \\(\\vec{u}=\\{u(y),0,0\\}\\) and \\(\\partial u(y)/\\partial x=0\\).\nThe sheet at \\(y\\) moves along the x-direction with a speed \\(u(y)\\). The sheet at \\(y+\\Delta y\\), which is \\(\\Delta y\\) away from the otehr sheet moves with a speed \\(u(y+\\Delta y)\\). Consider now the momentum \\(\\vec{p}=\\{m u(y),0,0 \\}\\) of the fluid sheet (don’t confuse with the pressure \\(p\\)). The total momentum change \\(d\\vec{p}\\) can be written as a substantial derivative\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nd\\vec{p}=\\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial t}dt +\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial x}dx}_{=0} + \\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial y}dy+\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial z}dz}_{=0}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=\\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\vec{p}}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{\\partial m u(y)}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is a force. This is the force that is responsible for the change in the fluid velocity along the y direction, which is parallel to the x-direction.\nSuch a force tangential to an area in the direction of motion is called a shear stress \\(\\tau\\), i.e.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tau=\\frac{F}{A}=\\frac{1}{A}\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=\\underbrace{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\frac{\\partial m u(y)}{\\partial y}}_{\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}}\\frac{1}{A}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWith \\(m=\\rho V\\) and \\(v=A L\\) this turns into\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tau=\\underbrace{L\\frac{dy}{dt}}_{\\frac{m^2}{s}}\\frac{\\partial \\rho u(y)}{\\partial y}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho u(y)\\) indicates a momentum density. This equation is actually a diffusion equation. On the left side we have a momentum current density (\\(\\tau\\)) and on the right side a momentum density gradient, which is multiplied by a prefactor with a unit of the diffusion coefficient. This prefactor, the momentum diffusion coefficient, is the kinematic viscosity\n\\[\n\\nu=\\frac{\\eta}{\\rho} \\tag{kinematic viscosity}\n\\]\nand thus\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tau_{yx}=\\frac{\\eta}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\rho u(y)}{\\partial y}=\\eta \\frac{\\partial u(y)}{dy}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwher I have sneaked in the dynamic viscosity \\(\\eta\\) and the index \\(yx\\), as this is one element of the stress tensor for a momentum transport along the y-axis when stresses are applied along the x-axis.",

    "text": "23.2 Solutions of the Stokes Equation\nThe Stokes equation is easier to solve than the Navier-Stokes equation as it has no time dependence. This also means that it is time symmetric and the a reversal of the motion of an object typically also creates a reversed flow field. This is very important for example for micro-organisms that would like to swim in water. Due to their small dimension they live at low Reynolds numbers and every symmetric motion they take is just yielding a wiggeling back and forth but no net motion. They therefore have to come up with some time-asymmetric motion to swim. This is summarized in a theorem that has been put forward by Edward Purcell.

    "text": "24.1 Thermo-osmosis\nWe want to evaluate the boundary flow for the case when the surface is charged and in contact with an electrolyte solution. In this case, we can refer to the Debye-Hückel theory, which we earlier developed. In addition, this double layer is subject to a temperature gradient tangential to the surface, which will be the source of the osmotic pressure gradient along the surface.\nFor this situation we have all equations at hand. We have first of all\nThe force density in the system is given by\n\\[\nf=-\\rho \\nabla \\psi + \\ldots\n\\]\nwhere the dots denote other terms (electrostriction, change of dielectric constant …), which exist, but which we neglect.\nFurther, we can write the pressure as the osmotic pressure of the ion density\n\\[\np=n k_B T=(n_++n_-)k_B T=\\left ( n_0(\\exp\\left (- \\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right )-1)+ n_0(\\exp\\left ( \\frac{e\\psi}{k_B T}\\right )-1) \\right ) k_B T\n\\]\nThe task is now to calculate the term \\(f_x-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\) using derivatives of the above written pressure. Note that we have to take the derivative of the temperature with respect to the position but assume the temperature in the Boltzmann factors constant.\nThe result of this a bit more lengthy calculation is that\n\\[\nf_x-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} =-nk_B T \\frac{1}{T}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} - \\rho \\psi \\frac{1}{T}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n\\]\nor in 3-dimensions\n\\[\n\\mathbf{f}-\\nabla p= -\\left(\\varrho \\psi+n k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\\right) \\frac{\\nabla T}{T}\n\\]\nThe term in fron of the fraction is an electrostatic interaction energy related term and a term corresponding to the ideal gas pressure. Both terms together clearly make up an enthalpy (energy + pressure x volume). In this case, they correspond to an excess enthalpy density as there is no contribution if there is no electrostatic surface charge involved.\nWe can therefore also write the boundary velocity \\(u_B\\) as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nu_B= -\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\int_0^{\\infty} z h(z)dz\\frac{\\nabla T_{||}}{T}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(h(z)\\) is the excess enthalpy density of the interaction of the liquid with the solid as compared to the liquid alone. As the interaction between liquid and solid is often attractive (van der Waals alone already is attractive), the excess enthalpy density is negative and the difference of force density and pressure density results in forces along the temperarture gradient, e.g. from the cold region to the hot region. If the excess enthalpy is positive, the flow is driven from hot to cold regions. Note that this flow is established in a thin liquid layer of thickness \\(\\lambda\\), which is only a few nanometers thin. Within these few nanometers the flow velocity rises from 0 to a few 10 \\(\\mu m/s\\).\nThe plot below calculates the integral over the product of \\(z\\) and the excess enthalpy for the electric double layer, assuming that some of the constants are 1 and the temperature gradient just gives a minus sign (assuming hot is on the left and cold is on the right).\nThe flow profile we have calculated saturates at the boundary velocity \\(u_B\\) as we have assumed this as the boundary condition at infinite distance. If there is a second surface at some distance, even though at finite distance but still large as compared to the interaction range, the velocity magnitude has to decay to zero towards this surface. Instead of assuming the complicated flow profile as depicted below, we can in cases where all other distances are large as compared to the interaction range \\(\\lambda_D\\) assume that the velocity directly at the interface is \\(u_B\\). The hydrodynamic boundary condition is thus altered from a no-slip boundary condition to a slip boundary condition with the slip velocity \\(u_B\\).",

    "text": "Freely Jointed Chain\n\n\n\n\n\n26.1.1 Mean-squared end-to-end distance of a FJC\nLet us calculate some properties of the freely jointed chain. One is the sum of all bonding vectors \\(\\vec{r}_i\\). This will give us the end-to-end distance, vector of the polymer chain.\n\\[\n\\vec{R}_N=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\vec{r}_i\n\\]\nOf course, this is only a single realisation of a polymer conformation. In general, the polymer can accommodate many different conformations with different end-to-end vectors \\(\\vec{R}_N\\). Therefore, ensemble average of the end to end vector has to be zero.\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\vec{R}_N\\right\\rangle=0 .\n\\]\nThe next higher moment of the end to vector distance is the mean squared end to end distance. The mean squared end to end distance is calculated by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\langle R^2\\right\\rangle & \\equiv\\left\\langle\\vec{R}_N^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\vec{R}_N \\cdot \\vec{R}_N\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\vec{r}_i\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^N \\vec{r}_j\\right)\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N\\left\\langle\\vec{r}_i \\cdot \\vec{r}_j\\right\\rangle .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe dot product in the last double sum can now be replaced by\n\\[\n\\vec{r}_i \\cdot \\vec{r}_j=b^2 \\cos \\theta_{i j}\n\\]\nsuch that we obtain\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R^2\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N\\left\\langle\\vec{r}_i \\cdot \\vec{r}_j\\right\\rangle=b^2 \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N\\left\\langle\\cos \\theta_{i j}\\right\\rangle\n\\]\nAs all bond angles \\(\\theta_{ij}\\) are allowed equally, the ensemble average over the cosine is just zero and we obtain\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R^2\\right\\rangle=n \\cdot b^2=L \\cdot b\n\\]\nwhich is not too surprising. This is the random walk with a step length of \\(b\\) but not with time steps but \\(N\\) segments. While the contour length of the polymer would be \\(N^2b^2\\) the mean sqared end to end distance is shorter and just \\(Nb^2\\).\n\n\n26.1.2 Distribution of the end-to-end distances\nThe calculation before just addressed the mean squared end to end distance. Again, since this is a random walk, which has many realisations, there must be also a distribution function for the end to end distance. This will tell us by how much the end to end distance fluctuates, and what is the probability to find a certain end to end distance. If we look just at the first segment, we have an end to end vector \\(\\vec{R}_1\\) magnitude squared, and we can calculate the length of this vector from its components.\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\left|\\vec{R}_1\\right|^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2\\right\\rangle=b^2=\\left\\langle x_1^2\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle y_1^2\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle z_1^2\\right\\rangle\n\\]\nAs the vector can rotate isotropically, the mean squared value of each of the components is just one third of the square length of the Kuhn segment \\(b\\), i.e.\n\\[\n\\left\\langle x_1^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle y_1^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle z_1^2\\right\\rangle=b^2 / 3\n\\]\nThat means now, a chain of \\(N\\) segments results in the mean squared components which are\n\\[\n\\left\\langle x_N^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle y_N^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle z_N^2\\right\\rangle=N \\cdot b^2 / 3\n\\]\nThis is the variance of how far a random walk travels in x-direction after \\(N\\) step. The distribution function for the random walk as we know is a Gaussian:\n\\[\np(x , N)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi\\left(N b^2 / 3\\right)}} e^{-x^2 /\\left(2 N b^2 / 3\\right)}\n\\]\nAs all 3 dimensions of the random walk are equivalent, i.e.\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_N^2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle x_N^2\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle y_N^2\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle z_N^2\\right\\rangle=3 \\cdot N \\cdot b^2 / 3=N \\cdot b^2\n\\]\nthe probability density of finding a certain end to end vector is the product of the three 1d probability densities\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\vec{R} , N) & =p(x, N) \\cdot p(y, N) \\cdot p(z, N) \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}} e^{-3 x^2 /\\left(2 N b^2\\right)} \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N a^2}} e^{-3 y^2 /\\left(2 N b^2\\right)} \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N a^2}} e^{-3 z^2 /\\left(2 N b^2\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand thus\n\\[\np(\\vec{R} , N)=\\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} e^{-3 R^2 /\\left(2 N b^2\\right)}\n\\]\nThe corresponding radial distribution function then reads\n\\[\np(R , N) d R=\\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} e^{-3 R^2 /\\left(2 N b^2\\right)} 4 \\pi R^2 d R\n\\]\nSuch and end to end distribution could be measured if both end of the polymer can be taggeg for example with a dye molecule. The distance of the two dye molecules can then be measured, for example, with the help of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) if some additional requirements are fullfilled. This can be done for a single polymer molecule and the above ensemble averages could then also be replaced by a time average since the polymer fluctuates due to thermal energy.\n\n\n26.1.3 Radius of gyration\nNot in all cases the end to end distance can be measured or even two ends exist (circular polymers). Then, it more intersting to characterize the spatial extent of the polymer chain by the radius of gyration \\(R_{g}\\), whose square is defined like this \\[\nR_{\\mathrm{g}}^2 \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(\\vec{R}_i-\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\vec{R}_j .\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=i}^N\\left\\langle\\left(\\vec{R}_i-\\vec{R}_j\\right)^2\\right\\rangle\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{i=1}^N \\rightarrow \\int_0^N \\mathrm{~d} u \\\\\n& \\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_u^N\\left\\langle(\\vec{R}(u)-\\vec{R}(\\mathrm{v}))^2\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{d} u .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle(\\vec{R}(u)-\\vec{R}(\\mathrm{v}))^2\\right\\rangle=(\\mathrm{v}-u) b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{b^2}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_u^N(\\mathrm{v}-u) \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{d} u=\\frac{b^2}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_0^{N-u} \\mathrm{v}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{v}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{d} u\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{b^2 N}{6}=\\frac{\\left\\langle R^2\\right\\rangle}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n\\hline \\text { Ideal chains } & \\text { Linear } & \\text { Ring } & f \\text {-arm star } & \\text { H-polymer } \\\\\n\\hline\\left\\langle R_g^2\\right\\rangle & N b^2 / 6 & N b^2 / 12 & {\\left[(N / f) b^2 / 6\\right](3-2 / f)} & \\left(N b^2 / 6\\right) 89 / 625 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{\\mathrm{g}}^2 \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(\\vec{R}_i-\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\vec{R}_j .\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=i}^N\\left\\langle\\left(\\vec{R}_i-\\vec{R}_j\\right)^2\\right\\rangle\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{i=1}^N \\rightarrow \\int_0^N \\mathrm{~d} u \\\\\n& \\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_u^N\\left\\langle(\\vec{R}(u)-\\vec{R}(\\mathrm{v}))^2\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{d} u .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle(\\vec{R}(u)-\\vec{R}(\\mathrm{v}))^2\\right\\rangle=(\\mathrm{v}-u) b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{b^2}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_u^N(\\mathrm{v}-u) \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{d} u=\\frac{b^2}{N^2} \\int_0^N \\int_0^{N-u} \\mathrm{v}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{dv} \\mathrm{v}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{d} u\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_{\\mathrm{g}}^2\\right\\rangle=\\frac{b^2 N}{6}=\\frac{\\left\\langle R^2\\right\\rangle}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n\\hline \\text { Ideal chains } & \\text { Linear } & \\text { Ring } & f \\text {-arm star } & \\text { H-polymer } \\\\\n\\hline\\left\\langle R_g^2\\right\\rangle & N b^2 / 6 & N b^2 / 12 & {\\left[(N / f) b^2 / 6\\right](3-2 / f)} & \\left(N b^2 / 6\\right) 89 / 625 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]",

    "text": "27.2 Gaussian Chain\nWe have previously seen that in the limit of N → ∞ all ideal chains become identical and follow the normal distribution as long as each step of the random walk for the chain conformation satisfies that it is uncorrelated with the previous step. A generalization of this concept is the Gaussian chain, which no longer considers the exact Kuhn segment length, but divides a long chain into equal flexible segments of arbitrary length:\n\n\n\nSSC\n\n\nIn this case, the “segment length” b is not a real length, but the ends of a segment have a square end-to-end distance of b. The end-to-end distance of a segment is also no longer fixed/rigid. Instead, the end-to-end vector of each segment is determined by the Gaussian probability distribution for an ideal chain:\n\\[\np\\left(\\vec{r}_i ; N\\right)=\\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi b^2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} e^{-3\\left|\\vec{r}_i\\right|^2 /\\left(2 b^2\\right)}\n\\]\nwith a variance of b2. The probability distribution for the end-to-end vector of the whole chain containing N Gaussian chain segments is according to the central limit theorem again Gaussian distributed and has N times the single segment variance:\n\\[\n\\left\\langle R_N{ }^2\\right\\rangle=N \\cdot b^2\n\\]\nLet us now consider that each segment is composed of n smaller Gaussian chain segments with root-mean-squared end-to-end distance of b0.

We call the ratio:\n\\[\np=\\frac{E I}{k_B T}\n\\]\npersistence length p, that provides the a measure of the flexural rigidity per length of the beam balanced by the thermal fluctuations.\nLet us describe the deflection of the tangent angles over larger length scales. i.e. Δs may be larger than p. Instead of the mean angular displacement we take the tangent-tangent correlation function as descriptor:\n\\[\ng(s)=\\langle\\vec{t}(s) \\cdot \\vec{t}(0)\\rangle=\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle=\\frac{d\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle}{d s} \\Delta s=\\langle\\cos \\underbrace{\\theta(s+\\Delta s)}_{\\theta(s)+\\Delta \\theta}-\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle=\\underbrace{\\langle\\cos \\theta \\cos \\Delta \\theta-\\sin \\theta \\sin \\Delta \\theta\\rangle}_{\\langle\\cos \\theta\\rangle\\langle\\cos \\Delta \\theta\\rangle-\\underbrace{\\sin \\theta\\rangle \\sin \\Delta \\theta\\rangle}_0}-\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle=\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle(\\langle\\cos \\Delta \\theta\\rangle-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta \\theta\\langle\\cos \\Delta \\theta\\rangle \\approx 1-\\left\\langle\\Delta \\theta^2\\right\\rangle / 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle}{d s} \\Delta s=\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle \\frac{\\left\\langle\\Delta \\theta^2\\right\\rangle}{2}=\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle \\frac{\\Delta s}{2 p}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\int_1^{\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle} \\frac{d\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle}{\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle}=\\int_0^s \\frac{d s}{2 p}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle\\cos \\theta(s)\\rangle=e^{-s / 2 p}\n\\]\nIn 3D we have an additional degree of freedom for the angular fluctuations, such that the mean-squared angular deflection for a short segment is twice as large.

    "text": "Interaction\n\n\n\n28.1.1 Interaction potential\nThe plots below show some example interaction potentials. The left graph displays the Lennard-Jones potential, the right one the hard sphere potential, which is also called an athermal potential, as there is no temperature in it due to the missing minimum.\nNote again, that this potential includes all effects of the solvent as well.\n\n\n\ntmp1\n\n\n\n\n28.1.2 Probability distribution\nThe probability distribution for finding the the monomers at a certain distance \\(r\\) is then given by the Boltzman factor\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np(r)=\\exp\\left (-\\frac{U(r)}{k_B T}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nFor the two potentials shown above, the probability therefore is zero wherever the potential is infinitely large. Whenever the potential is zero we find a probability density value of 1 while it is larger than 1 in the regions, where the potential is attractive.\n\n\n\ntmp2\n\n\n\n\n28.1.3 Mayer f-function\nThe Mayer f-function measures now the deviation of the probability from the regions where the potential is zero or the probability density gives 1. It is defined by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf(r)=\\exp\\left (-\\frac{U(r)}{k_B T}\\right)-1 \\tag{Mayer f-function}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\ntmp3\n\n\nThis definition makes sense if we consider the right example of a hard sphere interaction. The free volume can then be calculated by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nv=-\\int f(r)d^3r=\\int \\left[1-\\exp\\left (-\\frac{U(r)}{k_B T}\\right) \\right]d^3r\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is giving in the case of the hard sphere interaction just \\(4\\pi R^3/3\\), where R is the contact separation distance of the two spheres. Thus the volume integral over the Mayer f-function is directly giving the excluded volume for the pairwise interaction. Note that the excluded volume can also be negative. This happens, when the attractive interaction is very strong. It can also be zero, when both positive and negative areas under the Mayer f-function are of the same size.\n\n\n28.1.4 Polymer chain as a real gas\nOur further calculations will now base the excluded volume influence on the conformation of a polymer chain under the assumtion that all monomers (or actually Kuhn segments) are independet and don’t correlate in their position. They will thus behave like a real gas and show effect which we know from the van der Waals gas, such as co-volume and cohesive pressure. The two effects are actually corrections to the equation of state of the ideal gas, which can be written as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nZ\\equiv = \\frac{pV_m}{R T}=1 \\tag{compressibility factor}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(p\\) is the pressure, \\(V_m\\) the molar volume and \\(R\\) is the gas constant, i.e. \\(R=k_B N_A\\). For a real gas, the corrections have to scale with the density of the objects \\(\\rho=1/V_m\\) and we can write the compressibility factor as a Taylor series expansion\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nZ=\\frac{pV_m}{R T}= 1+ B(T)\\rho +C(T)\\rho^2 + D(T)\\rho^3+\\ldots \\tag{virial expansion}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is the viral expansion of the compressibility factor for a real gas. The coefficients \\(B(T),C(T),D(T)\\) are called the viral expansion coefficient.\nLet’s have a look at the first one in the case of a van der Waals gas, which is \\(B(T)\\). The presure of a van der Waals gas reads\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np=\\frac{RT}{(V_m-b)}-\\frac{a}{V_m^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(b\\) denotes the co-volume (the volume taken by the molecules themselves) and \\(a\\) amounts for the cohesive pressure of the gas molecules. If we set \\(a=0\\) we can write the compressibility factor\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nZ=\\frac{PV_m}{RT}=\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{b}{V_m}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nFor \\(b/V_m&lt;1\\), we can do a Taylor expansion which yields\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nZ=1+b\\frac{1}{V_m}+b^2\\frac{1}{V_m^2}+\\ldots=1+b\\rho +b^2 \\rho^2 + \\ldots\n\\end{equation}\\]\nComparing with the virial expansion above yields the fact that the virial expansion coefficient\n\\[\nB(T)=b\n\\]\nwhere b was the molar co-volume in the van der Waals equation, e.g. the excluded volume. Correspondingly, the virial expansion coefficient is given by the integral over the Mayer f-function, i.e. in spherical coordinates\n\\[\nB(T)=-\\int f(r)d^3r=-4 \\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(e^{-\\frac{U(r)}{k_B T}}-1\\right) r^{2} d^3r\n\\]\nUsing this relation, we have a way to introduce the monomer-monomer and monomer-solvent interaction that is hidden in the May f-function into the equation of state of a real gas of polymer segements. We will come back to this solution.",

    "section": "28.2 Non-spherical segments and Free energy of interaction of a real chain",
    "text": "28.2 Non-spherical segments and Free energy of interaction of a real chain\nWhile we have assumed so far (without emphasizing it to much) that the interaction of the monomers is radially symmetric (monomers are spheres), typical monomers are rather rod-like. Thus we should get an idea about how the free volume changes when we go from a sphere to the rod. The procedure below considers the free energy of the interaction and replaces a rod by a set of spheres. We can get an idea about the free energy of a chain by coming back to our osmotic pressure formula\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\Pi=n k_B T\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number density of molecules. The unit of pressure is \\(N/m^2\\) or \\(J/m^3\\), which is an energy density. The formula above tells us that adding a single molecule comes at some cost, which is \\(k_B T\\). Yet, this is an ideal gas consideration. If we want to add a contribution of the excluded volume, we can refer to the overlap fraction\n\\[\n\\Phi^*=b^3 \\frac{N}{R^3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(b\\) was the Kuhn length and \\(R\\) the root mean squared end-to-end distance. The number of monomer-monomer contacts was \\(N\\Phi^*\\), which finally gives \\(N^2/R^6\\) contacts per volume. The free energy of interaction per volume is therefore\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{F_\\mathrm{int}}{V}=k_B T(vc_m^2 + w c_m^3+\\ldots)=k_B T (v\\frac{N^2}{R^6}+w\\frac{N^3}{R^9}+\\ldots)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(c_m=N/R^3\\) is the monomer concentration. The first term in the above equation results from the monomer-monomer contacts as we introduced. The second term is accordingly the result of the contact between three monomers and so on. Therefore, this is also a virial expansion and the first virial expansion coefficient \\(v\\) is the excluded volume of the bimolecular monomer contact.\nThis consideration helps us to understand the role of non-spherical rodlike monomers or segments. If we have a rodlike segment of length \\(b\\) and radius \\(d\\), then the rod can be replaced by spherical monomers of radius \\(d\\). The number of spherical monomers per segment is then \\(b/d\\). Thus if a chain has \\(N\\) rodlike segments, then it can be replaced by \\(n=Nb/d\\) spherical monomers.\nIn case of hard-sphere interactions the overall contribution of the excluded volume to the free energy shall be independent of the fact if the rods are replaced by spheres so the term\n\\[\nvN^2/R^6\n\\]\nshall give the same results, and therefore\n\\[\nv_s n^2 = v_c N^2\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nw_sn^3=w_c N^3\n\\]\nWith the spherical volume \\(v_s=d^3\\) and \\(w_s=d^6\\) we find\n\\[\nv_c=v_s\\left (\\frac{n}{N}\\right )^2=v_s\\left(\\frac{b}{d} \\right )^2=b^2 d\n\\]\nThus the excluded volume for the interaction of two rods is larger than the actual rod volume itself, which is\n\\[\nv_0=bd^2\n\\]\nwhich is the result of random orientations. If the aspect ratio, i.e. the ratio of the two volumes \\(v_c/v_0\\) is large, this excess excluded volume is the driving force for a nematic (aligment) ordering of the rodlike segments as originally described by Onsager for liquid crystalline systems.",

    "text": "28.4 Flory theory (in a good solvent)\nFlory treated the question of equilibrium conformation of real chains using a mean field approach. The equilibrium size is set by a balance between excluded volume which tends to expand the chain size, and a restoring force due to loss of conformational entropy due to swelling. The energetic contribution due to excluded volume is given by the number of excluded volume interactions within a coil and the cost of each exclusion, \\(k_B T\\). The number of excluded volume interactions is just the probability of finding a monomer within the excluded volume of another. If we assume a mean density of monomers in the coil, \\(N/R^3\\), then the number of excluded volume interactions per monomer is \\(vN/R^3\\) and for \\(N\\) monomers in the coil, the energetic contribution is\n\\[\nF_{\\text {int }} \\approx k_B T v \\frac{N^{2}}{R^{3}}\n\\]\nThe entropic energy due to expansion of the coil is, as we have calculated before, given as\n\\[\nF_{\\text {entropic }} \\approx k_B T \\frac{R^{2}}{N b^{2}}\n\\]\nwhich gives a total free energy\n\\[\nF \\approx k_B T\\left(v \\frac{N^{2}}{R^{3}}+\\frac{R^{2}}{N b^{2}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total free enery as a function of the end to end distance \\(R\\) has two components which either decay with \\(R^{-3}\\) or increase with \\(R^2\\). Therefore this function has a minimum, i.e.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial F}{ \\partial R}\\bigg |_{R_{F}}=0\n\\]\nat a particular end to end distance, which is the so-called Flory radius \\(R_F\\). From the derivative we find\n\\[\nR_{F} \\approx v^{1 / 5} b^{2 / 5} N^{3 / 5}\n\\]\nwhich shows, that the size of a real polymer chain scales with \\(N^{3 / 5}\\), where \\(\\nu=3/5=0.6\\) is the Flory exponent, which has to be compared to \\(\\nu=1/2\\) for an ideal (Gaussian chain). The polymer size thus scales stronger with the number of segments in the polymer, which seems at first glance a small difference, but due to the large numbers involved for \\(N\\), this could make quite some difference.\ninsert experimental plot here\nThe simple approach taken by Flory provides surprisingly good results - more modern theories/calculations provide \\(R ∼ N^{0.588}\\). However, the success of the Flory theory is due to a cancelation of errors. The excluded volume contributions are overestimated as correlations between monomers (which decrease the probability of overlap) are not considered. At the same time, the entropic restoring force is also overestimated. Nevertheless, such approaches based on a mean field approximation of density combined with ideal chain conformation-derived entropy can provide quite useful results, for example in the case of an adsorbed chain. The treatment of the case for \\(v &lt; 0\\) in the preceding simple manner leads to an aphysical result for the coil size that minimizes the total free energy. Stabilizing terms need to be considered.",

    "text": "29.1 Form Factor\nWe would like to consider the form factor only, which gives us information on the polymer conformation. We have an incident plane wave with the wave vector \\(\\vec{q}_i\\) which is falling on our polymer chain. The wavevector has a direction and magnitude according to\n\\[\n\\vec{q}_i=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\vec{u}_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength. Note that you should take care of the corresponding refractive index \\(n\\) in the case of light scattering (\\(\\lambda=\\lambda_0/n\\)). We will neglect the refractive index in the following, as it does not change the qualitative results.\nThe scattered light is then observed in a different direction, e.g. along the direction \\(\\vec{u}_s\\), which results in a scattered wavevector \\(\\vec{q}_s\\). Considering now the scattered wave from two segments of the polymer at \\(\\vec{R}_i\\) and \\(\\vec{R}_j\\) results in a path length difference \\(\\Delta\\) between the two waves, that is given by the indcident wave path different and the scattered wave path difference.\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\vec{u}_i\\cdot \\vec{R}_j - \\vec{u}_s\\cdot \\vec{R}_j=(\\vec{u}_i-\\vec{u}_s)\\cdot \\vec{R}_j\n\\]\nThis path difference translates into a phase difference if the waves\n\\[\n\\varphi_{j}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}\\left(\\vec{u}_{\\mathrm{i}}-\\vec{u}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{R}_{j}=\\left(\\vec{q}_{\\mathrm{i}}-\\vec{q}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{R}_{j}=\\vec{q} \\cdot \\vec{R}_{j}\n\\]\nSince the magnitude of the incident and the scattered wavevectors are the same, i.e.\n\\[\n\\left|\\vec{q}_{i}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{q}_{s}\\right|=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}\n\\]\nwe can express the magnitude of the vector \\(\\vec{q}\\) denoting the momentum exchange during scattering, in terms of the scattering angle \\(\\theta\\)\n\\[\nq \\equiv|\\vec{q}|=2\\left|\\vec{q}_{i}\\right| \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)=\\frac{4 \\pi}{\\lambda} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nWith the help of the phase angle, we can now find the electric field amplitude of the scattered waves of all segments \\(j\\) with\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{s}}=E_{\\mathrm{i}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A \\cos \\left(2 \\pi \\nu t-\\varphi_{j}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich provides with its magnitude square also the intensity of the scattered wave.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{\\mathrm{s}} &=2 I_{\\mathrm{i}} A^{2} \\nu \\int_{0}^{1 / \\nu}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\cos \\left(2 \\pi \\nu t-\\varphi_{j}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\mathrm{~d} t \\\\\n&=2 I_{\\mathrm{i}} A^{2} \\nu \\int_{0}^{1 / \\nu}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\cos \\left(2 \\pi \\nu t-\\varphi_{j}\\right) \\cos \\left(2 \\pi \\nu t-\\varphi_{k}\\right)\\right] \\mathrm{d} t \\\\\n&=I_{\\mathrm{i}} A^{2} \\nu \\int_{0}^{1 / \\nu}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\left(\\cos \\left(4 \\pi \\nu t-\\varphi_{j}-\\varphi_{k}\\right)+\\cos \\left(\\varphi_{k}-\\varphi_{j}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\mathrm{d} t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first term in the sum turns out to be zero when integrated over time, such that only the difference of the the two individual phase angles is important.\n\\[\nI_{s}(\\vec{q})=\\underbrace{I_{i} A^{2} N^{2}}_{I_{s}(0)} \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\cos \\left(\\varphi_{k}-\\varphi_{j}\\right)}_{P(\\vec{q})}\n\\]\nThe latter double sum inlcuding a prefactor defines the from factor\n\\[\nP(\\vec{q}) \\equiv \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\vec{q})}{I_{\\mathrm{s}}(0)}\\tag{form factor}\n\\]\nInserting the expression for the individual phase angles yields\n\\[\nP(\\vec{q})=\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\cos \\left[\\vec{q} \\cdot\\left(\\vec{R}_{i}-\\vec{R}_{j}\\right)\\right]\n\\]\nWe therefore have to calculate the average over the phase angles or exchanged momentum times the position difference between two segments\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\cos \\left[\\vec{q} \\cdot\\left(\\vec{R}_{i}-\\vec{R}_{j}\\right)\\right]\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos \\left(q R_{i j} \\cos \\alpha\\right) \\sin \\alpha \\mathrm{d} \\alpha\\right] \\mathrm{d} \\beta\n\\]\nUsing\n\\[\n\\vec{q} \\cdot\\left(\\vec{R}_{i}-\\vec{R}_{j}\\right)=q R_{i j} \\cos \\alpha\n\\]\ndirectly gives us the idea that the averaged cosine results in a sinus cardinalis\n\\[\n\\left\\langle\\cos \\left[\\vec{q} \\cdot\\left(\\vec{R}_{i}-\\vec{R}_{j}\\right)\\right]\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\cos \\left(q R_{i j} x\\right) \\mathrm{d} x=\\frac{\\sin \\left(q R_{i j}\\right)}{q R_{i j}}\n\\]\nwhich is reminiscent of the single slit result or the Fourier transform of the segment distribution in the scattering objects components:\n\\[\nP(q)=\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\frac{\\sin \\left(q R_{i j}\\right)}{q R_{i j}}\n\\]",

The end-to-end distance distribution we have obtained earlier delivers the probability to find the ending segments of a polymer with \\(N\\) Kuhn segments of length \\(b\\) at a distance \\(R\\). We can use this expression as well to give a probability density to find two segments \\(i,j\\) at a distance \\(R_{ij}\\), which is then given by\n\\[\np(R_{i j} ; \\underbrace{|i-j|}_{N}) d R_{i j}=\\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi|i-j| b^{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} e^{-3 R^{2}\\left(2|i-j| b^{2}\\right)} 4 \\pi R_{i j}^{2} d R_{i j}\n\\]\nNote that the number of segments takes here the value N=|i-j|. Using this density distribution, we have to weight each contribution of the form factor with the corresponding probability density, i.e.\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nP(q)&=&\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin \\left(q R_{i j}\\right)}{q R_{i j}} P\\left(R_{i j},|i-j|\\right) 4 \\pi R_{i j}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} R_{i j}\\\\\n&=&\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{q^{2} b^{2}|i-j|}{6}\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nOne can transform the double sum above in the case of large segment number into a double integral.

This leads for example to a shear thinning in polymeric liquids but also to a shear thickening for other materials such as the corn starch.\nIn these nonlinear regions, we can still define an apparent viscosity as the ration of shear stress divided by shear strain. The viscosity we commonly refer to is, however, the viscosity measured in the limit of \\(\\gamma\\ll \\tau^{-1}\\).\nNote that all liquids display viscoelasticity even though the range where the viscosity is independent of the shear rate is very wide.

    "text": "31.4 Creep and Creep Recovery\n\n31.4.1 Creep\nAnother mechanical perturbation is the step stress that can be applied to watch the strain relax. This is called creep and switching of a constant stress is called creep recovery. For the study of creep relaxation processes we define a new quantity, which is the inverse of the shear modulus. It is called the shear creep compliance\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nJ(t)\\equiv \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{\\sigma} \\tag{Creep Compliance}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe relation of modulus and compliance is much like the relation of resistivity and conductivity. We can use again the Maxwell model to gain some insight.

At time \\(t=0\\), the compliance is given by the elastic part \\(1/G_M\\), while the slope at long times is given by \\(1/\\eta\\). For viscoelastic liquids we have in general\n\\[\nJ(t)=J_{eq}+\\frac{t}{\\eta}\n\\]\nwhere \\(J_{eq}\\) corresponds to the energy stored in the elastic part of the liquid, but the compliance grows linearly with time.

    "text": "32.1.1 Rouse Model\nIn the Rouse model, the polymer is approximated by a bead-spring model (Gaussian chain) of \\(N\\) segments:\n\\[\n\\gamma\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{R}_n}{\\mathrm{d}t}=k\\left [ \\vec{R}_{n-1} - \\vec{R}_{n} + \\vec{R}_{n+1} - \\vec{R}_{n}\\right ] +\\vec{f}_n(t),\n\\]\nwhere the force on the segment \\(n\\) at a position \\(\\vec{R}_n\\) is given by the forces exerted from the neighboring elements with a spring constant \\(k=3k_\\mathrm{B} T/b^2\\) and the thermal noise force \\(\\vec{f}_n(t)\\).\nEach of the segments is experiencing a friction given by the factor \\(\\gamma\\). The total friction on the Rouse chain is now assumed to be\n\\[\n\\gamma_\\mathrm{R}=N\\gamma\n\\]\nwhich needs some short explanation, as this is one key assumption of the Rouse model. Imagine you have 5 different rigid spheres each experiencing the same friction coefficient and they are far apart from each other. The total friction coefficient will be \\(5\\gamma\\). Yet if the spheres come closer to each other, the hydrodynamic flow fields around each sphere influence each other until the point when they are in close contact and act as a new body. In this case, the friction coefficient will not be just the sum of all friction coefficients. This means, that the assumption of the Rouse model is now that the individual beads cause only localized flow fields when fluctuating, which are, in turn, not influencing the motion of the other segments.\nAccording to that, we may write down the time to diffuse the size \\(R\\) of the polymer as\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{R}=\\frac{R^2}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}N \\gamma\n\\]\nwhich is the Rouse time. At times shorter than the Rouse time, the polymer exhibits viscoelastic relaxation modes. The longest relaxation mode is that of the whole chain, which is the Rouse time \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{R}\\). As the size of the polymer chain is approximately given by \\(R\\approx bN^{\\nu}\\) with \\(\\nu\\) beeing the fractal dimension (e.g., the Flory exponent) of the chain we obtain for the Rouse time\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{R}=N \\frac{\\gamma}{\\underbrace{k_\\mathrm{B} T}_{\\tau_{0}}} b^{2} N^{2 \\nu}=\\tau_{0} N^{2 \\nu+1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau_0\\) is the relaxation time for a single segment in the chain. Depending if we now consider an ideal or a real chain, we find different scaling of the Rouse time with the number of segments, i.e.:\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{R} \\propto\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\tau_{0} N^{2}  \\qquad \\text { for ideal chain }(\\nu=1 / 2) \\\\\n\\tau_{0} N^{11 / 5} \\quad \\,\\,\\text {for real chain in good solvent }(\\nu \\approx 3 / 5)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\nwhich is just a simple estimate.\nThe full calculation by Rouse for an ideal chain shows a similar result, which is\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{R}=\\frac{1}{6 \\pi^{2}} \\frac{\\gamma b^{2}}{k_\\mathrm{B} T} N^{2}.\n\\]\nTo summarize, on time scales smaller than \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{R}\\), we expect to find viscoelastic modes of the polymer contributing to the modulus, while for modes larger than \\(\\tau_\\mathrm{R}\\) everything should be diffusive.\n\n\n32.1.2 Zimm Model\nThe Zimm model takes care of the fact that each segment is generating a flow field that decays as \\(1/r\\) and is thus typically long range. Thus segments in the chain volume (the so-called pervaded volume) are coupled by hydrodynamics in solution. This has to be taken into account for the dynamics of the polymer chain and the fact that the Rouse model neglects that restricts its validity essentially to the melt region (a system of polymer chains without solvent) only.\nThis hydrodynamic coupling in the Zimm model changes the friction coefficient of the chain to\n\\[\n\\gamma_\\mathrm{Z}\\approx \\eta R\n\\]\nwith \\(R\\) being the root-mean-squared end-to-end distance of the polymwer chain as used also in the Rouse model. Thus the Zimm chain behaves hydrodynamically more like a solid sphere rather than a collection of individual beads.\nWith \\(R=bN^{\\nu}\\) we find for the Zimm relaxation time\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{Z} \\approx \\frac{R^{2}}{D_\\mathrm{Z}} \\approx \\frac{\\gamma_\\mathrm{Z}}{k_\\mathrm{B} T} R^{2} \\approx \\frac{\\eta}{k_\\mathrm{B} T} R^{3} \\approx \\frac{\\eta b^{3}}{k_\\mathrm{B} T} N^{3 \\nu}=\\tau_{0} N^{3 \\nu}\n\\]\nwhile the full calculation by Zimm shows\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{Z}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{3 \\pi}} \\frac{\\eta}{k_\\mathrm{B} T} R^{3}\\tag{Zimm time}.\n\\]\nUsing the exponents \\(\\nu\\) for the ideal and the real chains, we can now make predictions for the scaling of the Zimm relaxation time for both chains, which gives\n\\[\n\\tau_\\mathrm{Z} \\propto \\begin{cases}\\tau_{0} N^{3 / 2}  & \\text { for ideal chain }(\\nu=1 / 2) \\\\ \\tau_{0} N^{9 / 5}  & \\text { for real chain in good solvent }(\\nu=3 / 5)\\end{cases}.\n\\]\nThus, the scaling of relaxation times as predicted by the Zimm and the Rouse model are different. Which regime is valid has to be decided based on experimental results. As mentioned before, the Zimm model is rather valid for dilute polymer solutions, while the Rouse model rather applies to the dynamics of polymer chains in the melt.",

With \\(N-p\\) modes devayed, there is \\(pk_B T\\) still stored in the deformation of the chain. Thus the modulus amplitude for each mode is found to be\n\\[\nG(\\tau_P)\\approx \\frac{n}{V}k_B T p\n\\]\nand the modulus itself\n\\[\nG(t)\\approx \\frac{n}{V}k_B T \\sum_{p=1}^{N}\\exp\\left (-\\frac{t}{\\tau_P}\\right )\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\tau_p=\\frac{\\tau_0}{6\\pi^2}\\frac{N^2}{p^2}\n\\]\nFor large \\(N\\) we may convert the sum into an integral and obtain for the modulus\n\\[\nG(t)=n_{p} k_{B} T \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d p \\exp \\left(-p^{2} t / \\tau_{R}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} n_{p} k_{B} T\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{R}}{t}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n\\]\nwhich gives an inversse square root dependence for the modulus with time. This is valid only for short times, as the chain has a longest relaxation, which is teh Rouse time. Including this cut-off at long times we may write\n\\[\nG(t)\\approx \\underbrace{\\frac{nNk_B T}{v}\\frac{t}{\\tau_0}^{-1/2}}_{\\tau_0&lt;t&lt;\\tau_R}\\underbrace{\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{t}{\\tau_R}\\right )}_{t&gt;\\tau_R}\n\\]\n\n\n\ntmp4\n\n\n\n32.3.1.1 Shear modulus with oscillating deformation\nWith the calculations done above we may now also determine the frequency dependence of the shear modulus.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The properties of polymer solutions change when you increase the density of the solution. In the case of dilite solutions, we have already seen that the viscosity changes linearly with the concentration of the polymer. Whe the chains start to overlap, the neigboring chains impose constraints which influence the relaxation of the chains upon deformation.\nTo identify, when such a semi-dilute regime is reached, we can have a look at the volume fraction\n\\[\n\\phi=\\frac{n V b^{3}}{V}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of polymer chains, \\(V\\) is the sample vlume and \\(N\\) is the number of Kuhn segements of length \\(b\\). If we have now polymer chains of a size \\(R\\) (end-to-end distance), with a volume of \\(R^3\\) we can then fill our sample volume space filling with \\(n\\) chains such that the sample volume \\(V=nR^3\\). This results in a concentration that is given by\n\\[\n\\phi^{*}\\approx \\frac{Nb^3}{R^3}\n\\]\nwhich is the overlap concentration indicating that the chains start to overlap at this concentration. Since the size \\(R\\) of the chain can be now expressed by\n\\[\nR\\approx b \\left (\\frac{v}{b^{3}}\\right )^{2\\nu-1}N^{\\nu}\n\\]\naccording to our consideration of the Flory chain (\\(v\\) free volume, \\(\\nu\\) fractal dimension/Flory exponent), we find that the overlap concentration scales as\n\\[\n\\phi^{*}\\approx N^{1-3\\nu}\n\\]\nwith the number of segments in the chain. We therefore have\n\na dilute solution for \\(\\phi&lt;\\phi^{*}\\)\na semidilute solution for \\(\\phi^{*}&lt;\\phi\\ll 1\\)\na melt for \\(\\phi=1\\)\n\n\n\n\npolymer states\n\n\nDue to the overlap of the chains in the semidilute regime, there must be some length scale \\(\\xi\\) (called correlation length),such that\n\nfor \\(r&lt;\\xi\\) the monomers are just surrounded by solvent mostly or same chain monomers\nfor \\(r&gt;\\xi\\) the monomer starts to see other chains\n\nThis correlation length helps us to subdivide the chain into blobs of a size \\(\\xi\\). This size is determined by the free volume and the chain size again via\n\\[\n\\xi \\approx b \\left ( \\frac{\\nu}{b^3}\\right )^{2\\nu-1} g^{\\nu}\n\\]\nwith \\(g\\) segments in the blob. The correlation volume is then given by \\(\\phi=gb^3/\\xi^3\\) such that we can express the blob size as\n\\[\n\\xi \\approx b\\phi^{-\\frac{\\nu}{3\\nu-1}}\n\\begin{cases}\\phi^{-1}\\,&\\text{for }\\nu=1/2\\\\\n\\phi^{-3/4}\\,&\\text{for }\\nu=3/5\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFrom this, the number of segements per blob follow to scale as\n\\[\ng\\approx \\phi^{-\\frac{1}{3\\nu-1}}\n\\]\nSince for \\(r&gt;\\xi\\) the monomers sees other chains, excluded volume interactions are screened. Thus, a semidilute solution of polymer is like a “melt” of blobs. The blobs are the new segments of a random walk of the size\n\\[\nR\\approx \\xi \\left ( \\frac{N}{g}\\right )^{1/2}\\approx bN^{1/2}\\phi^{-\\frac{2\\nu-1}{6\\nu-2}}\\begin{cases}\n\\phi^{0}\\, & \\text{for }\\nu=1/2\\\\\n\\phi^{-1/8}\\, & \\text{for }\\nu=3/5\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe polymer size therefore changes only very weakly with the concentration. To understand the dynamics of these polymer solutions, we now need the two models we have refered to already earlier\n\nZimm model which was valid for a dilute solution where monomers are hydrodynamically coupled\nRouse model which typically is valid in a melt in the absence of entanglements and neglects hydrodynamic coupling\n\nSince there is a characteristic length scale in the structure of the semidilute solutions, the hydrodynamic coupling must also possess a characteristic length scale \\(\\xi_h\\) such that\n\nwhen \\(r&lt;\\xi_h\\) the segments are coupled by hydrodynamics and the Zimm model can be applied\nwhen \\(r&gt;\\xi_h\\) the hydrodynamics is screened and the system is comparable to a melt of blobs\n\nIn fact, this hydrodynamic length scale is assumed to be the same as the structural length scale \\(\\xi_h=\\xi\\) such that we have for the short length scales\nZimm dynamics\nHere the chain sections feel the hydrodynamic coupling which leads to a maximum relaxation time\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\xi}\\approx \\frac{\\eta_s \\xi^{3}}{k_B T}\\approx \\frac{\\eta_s b^{}3}{k_B T}\\phi^{-\\frac{3\\nu}{3\\nu-1}}\n\\]\nas already used earlier. Beyond this length scale the dynamics becomes Rouse like and we have the\nRouse dynamics\nwith the longest relaxation time being for the whole chain of blobs\n\\[\n\\tau_{chain}\\approx \\tau_{\\xi}\\left ( \\frac{N}{g}\\right )^{2}\\approx \\frac{\\eta_s b^{3}}{k_B T}N^2 \\phi^{\\frac{2-3\\nu}{3\\nu-1}}\n\\]\nscaling as\n\\[\n\\tau_{chain}\\approx \\begin{cases}\n\\phi\\, & \\text{for } \\nu=1/2\\\\\n\\phi^{0.31}\\, & \\text{for } \\nu=3/5\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwith the concentration of the chain \\(\\phi\\). With this longest relaxation time for the chain we can now obtain the diffusion coefficient of a chain in the semi-dilute regime, which is\n\\[\nD\\approx \\frac{R^2}{\\tau_{chain}}\\approx \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s b N} \\phi^{-\\frac{1-\\nu}{3\\nu -1}}\\approx D_{z}\\left (\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi^{*}}\\right )^{-\\frac{1-\\nu}{3\\nu-1}}\n\\]\nwith \\(D_z=k_B T/\\eta_s b N^{\\nu}\\). The diffusion coefficient therefore scales as\n\\[\nD\\approx \\begin{cases}\n\\phi^{0}\\, & \\text{for } \\nu=1/2\\\\\n\\phi^{-0.54}\\, & \\text{for } \\nu=3/5\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis scaling for the real chain with an exponent of \\(-0.54\\) is also found in the experiments.\ninsert experimetal image\n\n33.0.1 Stress Relaxation\nThe stress relaxation now follows the dynamics in the two regimes and can be obtained from the correponding relaxation time spectrum as we have introduced that also already earlier.\nFor \\(\\tau_0&lt;t&lt;\\tau_{\\xi}\\):\n\\[\nG(t)\\approx \\frac{k_B T}{b^3}\\phi \\left ( \\frac{t}{\\tau_0}\\right )^{-\\frac{1}{3\\nu}}\n\\]\nFor \\(\\tau_{\\xi}&lt;t&lt;\\tau_{chain}\\):\n\\[\nG(t)\\approx \\frac{k_B T}{b^3}\\phi^{\\frac{3\\nu}{3\\nu-1}} \\left ( \\frac{t}{\\tau_0}\\right )^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",

    "title": "35  Forces and Interactions in Soft Matter",
    "section": "",
    "text": "While we have discussed in the previous sections the thermodynamics of systems and the kinetics of phase transitions, we have made as few as possible assumptions on the interactions between the, i.e., liquid components of a mixture to highlight the importance of entropic and other effects. Now, we would like to have a close look at the possible types of interactions and their order of magnitude in soft matter systems. We may classify the interactions in the following way: - covalent interaction (chemical binding) - electrostatic (Coulomb) - dipolar (vdW) - dispersion (vdW) - fluctuation, depletion (entropic)\nThese interactions deliver the forces that hold soft matter together, even though the phases are characterized by density, free energy and entropy, but not by the forces.\nPairwise interaction energy – Before we go into further details, we may have a look at some general behavior again. Let us assume that the interaction energy between two atoms/molecules is given by\n\\[\n    w(r)=-\\frac{C}{r^n}\n\\]\nwith C being an interaction specific constant, then the force between the two species at a distanceris given by\n\\[\n    F(r)=-\\frac{\\mathrm dw(r)}{\\mathrm dr}=-\\frac{nC}{r^{n+1}}.\n\\]\nFor a material, which has a number densityρand thus the total number \\(ρ4πr^2 dr\\) molecules in a shell between \\(r,r+dr\\) around a molecule, we obtain the following total interaction energy per molecule (the standard chemical potential)\n\\[\n    \\mu^{0}=\\int_{\\sigma}^{L}w(r)\\rho 4\\pi r^2 \\mathrm dr=\\frac{-4\\pi C\\rho}{(n-3)\\sigma^{n-3}}\\left [ 1-\\left (\\frac{\\sigma}{L}\\right )^{n-3}\\right ].\n\\]\nThe total interaction energy, and thus also the property of the system will thus depend on the size \\(L\\) of the system, except we assume \\(n&gt;3\\) and$ L&gt;&gt;σ$, where \\(σ\\) is the size of the molecule. This states nothing else, that long range interactions may yield system dependent properties or bulk properties do not depend on the volume size only if objects become small. Obviously Coulomb interactions, or dipolar interactions may not satisfy the above assumptions. We can find out some general rule about the cohesive energy of molecule with its neighbors in a liquid, when comparing the molar gas and molar liquid volumes. A typical gas molar volume is \\(22.400~ \\mathrm{cm^3/mol}\\), while this is only \\(20~ \\mathrm{cm^3/mol}\\) for a liquid. If liquid and gas coexist at a certain temperature \\(T\\),then the chemical potential of gas and liquid have to be the same, i.e.,\n\\[\n    \\mu^{0}_\\mathrm{gas}+k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln(X_\\mathrm{gas})=\\mu^{0}_\\mathrm{liq}+k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln(X_\\mathrm{liq})\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\mu^{0}_\\mathrm{gas}-\\mu^0_\\mathrm{liq}\\approx -\\mu^{0}_\\mathrm{liq}=k_\\mathrm{B}T \\ln\\left (\\frac{X_\\mathrm{liq}}{X_\\mathrm{gas}}\\right)\\approx 7 k_\\mathrm{B}T\n\\]\nassuming that there is essentially no cohesive energy in the gas phase. At the vaporization temperature, the energy required to release one mole of molecules from its cohesion with its neighboring molecules to the gas phase is thus\n\\[\nU_\\mathrm{vap}=-N_{A}\\mu^0_\\mathrm{liq}=7N_\\mathrm{A}k_\\mathrm{B}T.\n\\]\nThis allows us to estimate the latent heat of vaporization\n\\[\n\\Delta H_\\mathrm{vap}=U_\\mathrm{vap}+pV\\approx 7 R T_\\mathrm{B}+RT_\\mathrm{B}\n\\]\nAccording to that, the ratio of latent heat of vaporization and boiling temperature is \\(\\frac{\\Delta H_\\mathrm{vap}}{T_{B}}\\approx 8 R\\approx 80 \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{K\\, mol}}\\) per mole, or \\(9 k_\\mathrm{B} T\\) per molecule. If we assume that each molecule has on average 6 neighbors in a liquid, than we obtain a value of \\(\\frac{3}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\) as energy molecular pair. The about rough rule is called Troutons rule and gives only a very rough estimate of the cohesive energy, as it completely neglects the details of the interactions. However, it demonstrates why the thermal energy is important in soft matter.\n\n35.0.1 Coulomb forces, charge–charge interactions\nThe simplest form but at the same time, also one of the most important types of interaction is the electrostatic interaction, e.g., of simple charges. This type of interaction is important not only due to its relevance in biological systems, but the electrostatic interaction is in principle the only one delivering a long range repulsive forces.\nCharge–charge interactions Charge–charge interactions are mediated by the electric fields. Assume that we have a charge \\(Q_1\\) that creates an electric field\n\\[\nE_{1}=\\frac{Q_{1}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^2}.\n\\]\nWe neglect the vectorial character of the electric field to avoid further complications. The electric field is creating a force on a second charge \\(Q_2\\)\n\\[\nF(r)=Q_{2}E_{1}=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^2}.\n\\]\nIn this charge assembly at a distanceris an energy stored, which is the potential energy of assembling these two charges from infinity. The free energy of the two charges thus reads\n\\[\nw(r)=\\int_{\\infty}^{r}-F(r)\\mathrm dr=-\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^{2}}\\mathrm dr=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r}.\n\\]\nIf we evaluate this energy, for example, for a sodium and a chlorine ion at a distance of \\(r=0.276\\, \\mathrm{nm}\\) we find a free energy of interaction of \\(w=-8.4\\cdot 10^{-19}\\, \\mathrm{J}\\), which corresponds to about \\(200\\, k_\\mathrm{B}T\\) at \\(300~\\mathrm{K}\\) temperature. This is on the same order of magnitude than covalent interactions. It requires about \\(3~\\mathrm{nN}\\) to break this bond and the long range character of electrostatics becomes clear when evaluating the distance at which this interaction becomes comparable to \\(k_\\mathrm{B}T (r=56\\, \\mathrm{nm})\\). This is only considering a pair of ions. In a NaCl crystal, multiple neighbors contribute to the interaction energy of one sodium ion with its surrounding. One sodium ion has 6 Cl– neighbors at a distance of \\(r=0.276\\, \\mathrm{nm}\\), 12 Na+ neightbors at \\(\\sqrt{2}r\\),and further 8 Cl– neighbors at \\(\\sqrt{3}r\\) and so on. We have to sum up all the interaction energies for the total cohesive energy of the sodium ion in the crystal\n\\[\n\\mu^{0}=-\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r}\\left [ 6-\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}-\\frac{6}{2}+\\ldots\\right]=-1.748\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r}.\n\\]\nThe factor in front of the Coulomb term (the one in the square brackets) is termed Madelung constant and is known from solid state physics. It is characteristic for specific lattice types such as a simple cubic lattice in this case. Note that the cohesive energy of one sodium ion therefore is about \\(350\\, k_\\mathrm{B}T\\) and is thus much larger than the thermal energy keeping the NaCl crystal stable. Yet it can be dissolved in water very easily.\nBorn energy of solvation The Born energy of solvation calculates the free energy of assembling a charge inside a dielectric medium of dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon\\). Let us shortly reconsider the free energy\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathrm dU&=&\\mathrm dQ+\\mathrm dW\\\\ \\mathrm dU&=&T\\mathrm dS+\\mathrm dW\\\\ \\mathrm dW&=&\\mathrm dU-T\\mathrm dS\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[\n\\mathrm dF=\\mathrm dU-T\\mathrm dS=\\mathrm dW.\n\\]\nTherefore, the free energy change is related to the energy to assemble a charge\n\\[\n\\Delta F=\\frac{\\epsilon \\epsilon_{0}}{2}\\int_{V}E^{2}\\mathrm dV.\n\\]\nTo find the free energy we, therefore, integrate the square of the electric field over the volume (this is actually the same as adding tiny charge elements against previously assembled parts of the charge). According to that, the free energy of a charge in a medium with dielectric constant \\(ϵ\\) is\n\\[\n\\mu^{0}=\\frac{z^2e^2}{8\\pi \\epsilon \\epsilon_{0}a}\n\\]\nif the charge has a radius \\(a\\). If we look now at the difference of assembling the charge in vacuum (with \\(\\epsilon\\) =1) and in a medium with \\(\\epsilon\\),we find the following difference in the chemical potential (free energy)\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mu^{0}=\\frac{z^2e^2}{8\\pi \\epsilon_{0}a}\\left (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1\\right )=-\\frac{28z^2}{a}\\left (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1\\right ).\n\\]\nThis is the Born free energy of solvation of a single ion. The molar free energy is then obtained by multiplication with the Avogadro number \\(N_\\mathrm{A}\\)\n\\[\n\\Delta G=N_\\mathrm{A}\\Delta \\mu^{0}=-\\frac{69z^2}{a}\\left (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}-1\\right )\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mu^{0}\\approx \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon (a_{+}+a_{-})}\n\\]\nThe mole fraction that is dissolved in water is then found by the Boltzmann factor\n\\[\nX_{s}=e^{-\\frac{\\Delta \\mu^{0}}{k_\\mathrm{B}T}}\n\\]\nwhich is a measure for the solubility of the ions. Inserting the formula for the chemical potential delivers the proportionality \\(X_{s}\\propto \\exp(-\\mathrm{const}/\\epsilon)\\). This dependency on the dielectric constant of the solvent is indeed observed in the experiment, even though this is only a trend and there are solvents with marked deviations. The reason for that is essentially that the theory just assumes 1) continuous changes in the interactions, despite the fact that there is a near order and 2) that additional interactions like hydrogen bonds exist.\nInteractions involving polar molecules\nMany molecules exhibit dipole or even higher moments due to the fact that the charges are not evenly distributed over the molecular structure. Some of the atoms exhibit a stronger tendency to accept charges than others. This is typically measured by electronegativity and provides an idea of whether atoms rather donate or accept a charge when binding to other atoms. While homo-atomic bonds therefore do not have dipole moments heteroatomic bonds do (see table).\n\n\n\nBond\nDipole moment\n\n\n\n\nC-C\n0\n\n\nC-N\n0.22\n\n\n\nThe dipole moment of a molecule is measured by the displacementlof two charges \\(±q\\) from each other\n\\[\n    \\vec{u}=q\\vec{l}.\n\\]\nIts direction is from the negative to the positive side. It creates an electric field that is given by\n\\[\n    \\vec{E}=\\frac{3(\\vec{u}\\cdot \\hat{r})\\hat{r}-\\vec{u}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^{3}}.\n\\]\nThe dipole self-energy, i.e., the energy to create the dipole in a solvent is given by\n\\[\n    \\mu^{0}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon}\\left [ \\frac{q^2}{2a}+\\frac{q^2}{2a}-\\frac{q^2}{l}\\right ].\n\\]\n\\(F\\) or \\(l=2a\\) this yields \\(μ^0=q^2/(8πϵ_0 ϵa)=u^2/(4πϵ_0 ϵl^3 )\\) and thus yields a similar dependence of the chemical potential on the dielectric function \\(ϵ\\) as in the case of a single charge. The result is a similar dependence of the solubility on the dielectric function.\nIon–dipole interaction\nThe interaction energy of a dipole with a charge can be calculated by\n\\[\nw(r)=-\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon}\\left [ \\frac{1}{r-\\frac{1}{2}l \\cos(\\theta)}-\\frac{1}{r+\\frac{1}{2}l \\cos(\\theta)}\\right ]=-\n    \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^2}\\cos(\\theta)=-uE\\cos(\\theta),\n\\] {#eqn:energy}\nwhere the last two equations are assuming that the distance between both objects \\(r\\) is much larger than the extent of the dipole \\(l\\) itself. From equation @ref(eqn:energy), we see that the interaction can be either attractive or repulsive. An angle \\(\\theta=0^\\circ\\) results in an attractive interaction, while \\(\\theta=180^\\circ\\) yields repulsive interaction. Using a single chargee(Na+ ion) and a dipole of \\(u=1.85\\, \\mathrm{D}\\) (water molecule) results in an interaction energy of about \\(39\\, k_\\mathrm{B}T\\). Ions align and bind polar molecules like water, for example. For arbitrary polar molecules this is called solvation, while for water the term hydration is used. The strength of the hydration can effect the mobility of ions in solution as it makes them effectively charges and is of interest, for example, for the study of ion transport through ion channels, as this requires stripping the hydration shell.\nDipole–dipole interactions\nThe interactions of two dipoles \\((u_1, u_2)\\) in the solution can be also calculated following the above scheme\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    w(r,\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2},\\phi)=-\\frac{u_{1}u_{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon r^3}\\left [ 2\\cos(\\theta_{1})\\cos(\\theta_{2})-\\sin(\\theta_{1}\\sin(\\theta_{2})\\cos(\\phi))\\right ].\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAlso in this case the dipole–dipole interaction yields an orientation dependence with either repulsive or attractive interactions. The figure below shows the distance dependence for two configurations where the dipoles are arranged parallel but either along the connecting line or perpendicular to it.\nRotating dipoles, angle averaged Potential\n\n\n35.0.2 van der Waals interactions\n\n\n35.0.3 Depletion Forces\nDepletion force between two plates \nDepletion force between two spheres – To describe the depletion interaction between two spheres (radius \\(R\\)) in a solution of smaller spheres (radius \\(σ/2\\)), we may use the same approach of assuming an isotropic osmotic pressure of the smaller spheres. The smaller spheres can actually not approach a spherical shell of thickness \\(σ/2\\) around the larger spheres or a total volume of \\(4π(R+σ/2)^3/3\\) . The pressure on the large spheres has no consequences except in the case where the two spheres approach closer than \\(r≤2(R+σ/2)=2R_d\\). In this case the two excluded volumes around each sphere overlap to a lens-like volume. Due to this overall, the forces which create the pressure on the spherical surface up to an angle \\(θ_0\\) are unbalanced from the other side of the surface (see image) and result in an attractive interaction.\nThe total force is then calculated from the osmotic pressure times the surface area of the spherical cap by just taking into account the force components along the connecting line. This the read\n\\[\nF(r)=-2nk_\\mathrm{B}T\\pi (R+\\sigma/2)^2\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\theta_{0}}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\mathrm d\\theta\n\\]\nresulting in\n\\[\nF(r)=-nk_\\mathrm{B}T\\pi (R_{d})^2\\left [ 1+\\left ( \\frac{r}{2R_{d}}\\right )^2\\right ]\n\\]\nwhich is valid if the distance between the centers of the large spheres is \\(r&lt;2(R+\\sigma/2)\\). For \\(r\\geq 2(R+\\sigma/2)\\) there is no depletion of the smaller spheres from the region between the larger spheres and the force is zero, i.e., \\(F(r)=0\\).\nGeneral description – A more general description of the depletion interaction may be obtained based on our introduction into statistical physics at the beginning of the course. There we stated that the probability of finding a system in a stet of energy \\(E\\) is\n\\[\np(E)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta E}}{Z},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta=1/k_\\mathrm{B}T\\) and the partition function \\(Z\\) is\n\\[\nZ=\\sum_{i}e^{-\\beta E_{i}}\n\\]\nfor a system with a discrete number of states numbered by the indexi.For a single particle with a continuous number of energies the energy may look like\n\\[\nE=\\frac{p^2}{2m}+U(q),\n\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is some general coordinate. The classical partition function for a system of N particles is then\n\\[\nZ=\\frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}\\int \\mathrm d^{3}p^{N}\\int \\mathrm d^{3}q^{N}\\exp\\left ( -\\beta \\left [ \\sum_{i}\\frac{p^2}{2m}+U(q^N)\\right ]\\right ),\n\\]\nwhere we use the notation \\(p^N\\) and \\(q^N\\) to denote the whole set of variables. The prefactor is appropriate for indistinguishable particles and the phase space normalization factor \\(h\\) (Planck’s constant) for every pair of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Since there is no issue of the non-commutation of positions and momenta we can perform the momentum integrals exactly, yielding\n\\[\nZ=\\frac{1}{N!}\\frac{1}{\\Lambda^{3N}}\\int \\mathrm d^{3}q^{N}\\exp(-\\beta U(q^{N})),\n\\]\nwhere the thermal de Broglie wavelength \\(\\Sigma\\) is\n\\[\n\\Lambda=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_\\mathrm{B}T}}.\n\\]\nIn the case of two interacting large spheres in a solution of small spheres with all spheres being hard spheres, the integration over the exponential function yields\n\\[\nZ=\\frac{V_{A}^{N}}{N! \\Lambda^{3N}}\n\\]\nwith \\(V_A\\) being the volume available to the small spheres, i.e., $V_A=V-V_{E}^{’} $ for \\(r&lt;D+d\\) and \\(V_A=V-V_E\\) for \\(r&gt;D+d\\) with \\(V_E=\\pi(D+d)^3/3\\) and \\(V_{E}^{'}=V_E-(2\\pi l^2)/3 [3(D+d)/2-l]\\) and \\(l=(D+d)/2-r/2\\). The calculation then yields the free energy\n\\[\nG=-k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln(Z) =-k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln\\left (\\frac{V_{A}^N}{N!\\Lambda^{3N}}\\right).\n\\]\nUsing Stirling’s formula again this can be turned into\n\\[\nG=G_\\mathrm{ideal}-Nk_\\mathrm{B}\\ln\\left (\\frac{V_{A}}{V}\\right).\n\\]\nThe ideal contribution to the free energy is constant with the separation of the large sphere, so it does not contribute to the depletion force. It reads\n\\[\nG_\\mathrm{ideal}=-Nk_\\mathrm{B}T\\left (1-\\ln\\left (\\frac{N\\Lambda^3}{V}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\nThe distance-dependent part still contains the logarithm which we can approximate by\n\\[\n\\ln\\left (\\frac{V_{A}}{V}\\right)\\approx -\\frac{V_{E}}{V}+\\frac{\\pi}{6V}(D+d-r)^2(D+d+r/2)\n\\]\nfor the case of the overlapping excluded volumes. This gives then finally a force\n\\[\nF=-\\frac{N}{4V}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\pi(D+d-r)(D+d+r)\n\\]\nfor \\(r&lt;d+D\\). For all other distances of the two centers of the spheres, the depletion force is zero.",
