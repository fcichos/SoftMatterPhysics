    "The Stokes equation is easier to solve than the Navier-Stokes equation as it has no time dependence. This also means that it is time symmetric and the a reversal of the motion of an object typically also creates a reversed flow field. This is very important for example for micro-organisms that would like to swim in water. Due to their small dimension they live at low Reynolds numbers and every symmetric motion they take is just yielding a wiggeling back and forth but no net motion. They therefore have to come up with some time-asymmetric motion to swim. This is summarized in a theorem that has been put forward by Edward Purcell. We will talk about this later.\n",
