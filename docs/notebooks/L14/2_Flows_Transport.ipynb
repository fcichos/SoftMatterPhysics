    "For describing the transport and the dynamics of objects we need to write down some basic relations that will later gover our analysis. One is of course the continuity equation essentially stating that in the absence of sources or sinks, material flowing into a system has to move out of it as well. The flow is characterized by a current density $\\textbf{j}$. The flow through a surface is then goverened by the normal components of the flow with respect to the surface having a normal $\\textbf{n}$. \n",
