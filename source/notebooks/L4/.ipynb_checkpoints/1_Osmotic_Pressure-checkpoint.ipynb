Salt water is pumped through a membrane, which is selectively preventing ions from passing the membrane. Due to the osmotic pressure difference between the salt free and the salty regions, high pressures are required to pump the water through these membranes. Yet, the technical realizations of this method come close to the thermodynamic limit of this process. \n",
