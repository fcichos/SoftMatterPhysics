Viscoelsatic behavior is a mixture of viscous behavior, which we know already from simple liquids and elastic behavior, which is typical for solids. Yet, this mixture is not just a simple superposition but often quite complex and depdning on the way mechanical deformation is introduced. 

**insert sketch***

As already previously introduced, we can define a **shear stress** 

$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$

as the tangential force $F$ to an area $A$. As a response to such a stress, the material deforms

## Maxwell Model
A model for a viscoelastic liquid is the Maxwell model being a serial combination of a spring and a dashpot (viscous element).

## Kelvin-Voigt
The Kelvin-Voigt model is a parallel combination of both elements and can grasp some features of a viscoelastic solid. It can however not describe the behavior for step strain.

## Standard Model
A better model for visoelastic solids is the standard linear solid model comprising three mechanical elements.
